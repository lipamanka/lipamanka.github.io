    <summary id="apr-17">Self Improvement (April 17th)</summary>

    <p>It's what it says on the tin. This journal is supposed to document my self-improvement, for all to see, if you can find it. I think my self-esteem is strong enough that if I were to list my flaws, I wouldn't feel terrible about myself. Especially if I frame it from the perspective of self improvement. So here goes.</p>

        <summary>Letting Things Go</summary>
        <p>I've always struggled with this. In middle school, my science teacher told me to pick my battles, and I didn't get it. Why can't I fight? Why can't I do everything? I'm still figuring out the answers to those questions, but no matter what they are, I know that to be kind to others is to take a step back and focus on something else.</p>

        <p>Even if after the fact I can identify when I've acted like this, I have been unable to identify these feelings in the moment. At my first job at age 17, I got into an argument with a camper over something that I can now recognize as inconsequential. But in the moment, it felt like the right thing to argue, to engage, even though I was right and he was wrong.</p>

        <p>Even today, I interrupted a huge rehearsal to argue with my choral director. I should not have done that, but in the moment it felt like the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>In most cases where I have failed to let things go, I have been technically correct. But that doesn't mean arguing about the thing is important. Looking at things big picture will help me process my response. Noticing emotions escalating will help me prevent them from getting worse.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I feel like I'm too far in. My costs are sunk and all that. Like as soon as I realize that I shouldn't have engaged at all, I feel like it would be embarassing to admit that and change my behavior. Even if it's embarassing to me, it's still the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>Naming my struggles with letting things go is the first step to letting them go. The second step is action plans, and those action plans are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Paying attention to my emotions more, even when they're positive.</p></li>
            <li><p>Take my ADHD medication more regularly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Admit when I make mistakes as soon as I realize it, but wait to apologize until after I understand.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <summary>Close-Mindedness</summary>
        <p>There are so many angles to think about the world. I am limited to the angles I have access to. My perspectives are informed by my background, and often I am not open to other perspectives.</p>

        <p>It is crucial to point out that because I have many priviledges, closing myself off to other perspectives is actively harmful to those at the lower ends of power dynamics I participate in. I have definitely thought about this context before, but it's not where I struggle most in my opinion.</p>

        <p>In political discussions, I am sometimes unable to tell the difference between "these opinions are harming me" and "these opinions are different from mine." In person it's easier for me to acknowledge the flesh and blood of those I speak to. This makes me more careful, but online it's really hard to not see a disagreement as a type of bigotry I need to fight.</p>

        <p>There are absolutely times when people need to be called out. But as soon as it becomes performative, it does no good. If a disagreement harms nobody, it is not my place to escalate the conversation.</p>

        <p>Cognatively, I am aware that differing perspectives are valuable and good to have, but I don't think my amygdala has figured that out yet. I think my amygdala is prone to act up very easily, especially when I'm off my ADHD medication.</p>

        <p>So what do I do to get better? Well, I think I already have been, passively. I think there are more mild approaches that I can apply broadly over a direct callout. The rabbinic approach of asking questions seem useful. Instead of disagreeing, I can ask questions. Though I have already been doing this. I don't know what I can work on changing that can help me improve myself here.</p>

    <p>That's about all I can think of right now. I am going to sleep now, good night. I'll write more next time I feel like it.</p>

    <summary id="apr-22">Bragging (April 22nd)</summary>
    <p>So like. When I was in middle school, I joined a scout troop. This wasn't boy scouts, this was Baden-Powell scouts, which has been unisex for over a century I think? But besides that it was basically boy scouts. And there was a girl in my troop who called me out on my bullshit, and I am forever thankful to her. She changed the way I act on a fundemental level.</p>

    <p>She was always calm and collected, observing. We would meet once weekly in Prospect Park, and she'd always be there, watching. She spoke a lot too, but not too much. Not like me.</p>

    <p>Then one day, she said to me, plainly, "lipamanka, you're so braggy. You need to stop bragging. It's really annoying."</p>

    <p>I felt devistated. I have always been sensitive to rejection, and this hit me like a sack of steel shovels. But I didn't express this sensitivity outwards. I didn't lash out. I spent the rest of the day listening. And I think I grew from that.</p>

    <p>A couple of years later, I was on the way home from my father's parent's house, with my parents, and we were giving a family friend a ride home as well. I wanted to talk to her about high school, because I was about to start. Perhaps it was uncharacteristic of me, but I asked her for advice on how to make friends.</p>

    <p>Without skipping a beat, she answered. "Questions. Questions, questions, questions. You just have to ask questions to everyone you meet. Don't bring up facts about yourself, only ask questions about them. If they answer your questions, they're an acquaintence. If they ask you about yourself, you've just made a friend."</p>

    <p>Sometimes I forget about this wisdom, but I try to live my life by it. If she ever dies, I'll tell this story at her funeral. I still see her at least three times a year, if not more frequently. We're close enough that I'd be invited, at least. Of course, that's morbid, but how can we afford to forget death when it is at the end of all life?</p>

    <p>Recently, I've been interacting with some people who brag a lot. It's brought out the bragger from the midst of myself, for behold, it is in my nature. But I don't like being like this. Every time I see myself brag, I can do little to stop it. It feels like I've gone so long without bragging that I deserve some time to brag, just this once. It's a treat. I've earned it by asking questions. And no, absolutely not; bragging is not a gift from anyone else to me. Bragging is something I do, and it is not a likable thing to do, so I should stop. It doesn't even feel good. It's just a reflex.</p>

    <p>So what am I to do? I don't want to cut braggers out of my life, but if I don't figure out something else, I'll soon become a bragger once again. This is not something I wish to happen.</p>

    <summary id="apr-28">Forgiveness and Friendsmaxxing</summary>
    <p>Even if I'm able to get better and regain semblence of repport within specific communities that I have been a bad actor in, I don't want to forgive certain people. And I don't have to. There are some people who I think are genuinely not good and I don't like them.</p>

    <p>I need to get my feelings down so I can go to sleep, so here goes.</p>

    <p>Friendsmaxxing is the process by which someone caters the way they interact with people to try to get people to like them. I don't think it's very effective if done alone. Friendmaxxers will pay attention to what behavior makes people like them more, what gets them more status, etc, and do that. They will not feel kinly emotions during interactions. None of this is a bad thing on its own, but it becomes a bad thing when they mascarade as people who are interacting without friendsmaxxing.</p>

    <p>A friendsmaxxer may, in addition to this, attempt to act in such a way to make the other party feel like there is a genuine social connection, even when there is not. When this is the primary way people interact with others, it becomes malicious people-pleasing.</p>

    <p>There are multiple people who do this. I don't need to forgive them, and I won't. I don't really care what's going up there but if you can't have a normal human connection with me with emotions and also pretend to be having normal human connections with me with emotions, then I cannot justify being friends with you.</p>

    <p>I am being careful here to exclude those with cluster B personality disorders from this. Such people are often fantastic apologizers and expertly explain their personality disorders and how they affect communication. If an antisocial person tells me that they don't feel empathy, but are still looking for a connection, I am happy to oblidge. If someone without any antisocial traits tricks me into being their friend through decite, they have committed a transgression against me.</p>

    <p>So while I will improve and become better in every way I need to, I am under no obligation to forgive the people who have tried to friendmax me, the people who thought it was an okay thing to do to pull together a long document listing all of my social flaws, the people who held their power over me while still trying to glean friendship from me. That fucking sucks.</p>
