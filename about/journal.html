    <summary id="apr-17">Self Improvement (April 17th)</summary>

    <p>It's what it says on the tin. This journal is supposed to document my self-improvement, for all to see, if you can find it. I think my self-esteem is strong enough that if I were to list my flaws, I wouldn't feel terrible about myself. Especially if I frame it from the perspective of self improvement. So here goes.</p>

        <summary>Letting Things Go</summary>
        <p>I've always struggled with this. In middle school, my science teacher told me to pick my battles, and I didn't get it. Why can't I fight? Why can't I do everything? I'm still figuring out the answers to those questions, but no matter what they are, I know that to be kind to others is to take a step back and focus on something else.</p>

        <p>Even if after the fact I can identify when I've acted like this, I have been unable to identify these feelings in the moment. At my first job at age 17, I got into an argument with a camper over something that I can now recognize as inconsequential. But in the moment, it felt like the right thing to argue, to engage, even though I was right and he was wrong.</p>

        <p>Even today, I interrupted a huge rehearsal to argue with my choral director. I should not have done that, but in the moment it felt like the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>In most cases where I have failed to let things go, I have been technically correct. But that doesn't mean arguing about the thing is important. Looking at things big picture will help me process my response. Noticing emotions escalating will help me prevent them from getting worse.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I feel like I'm too far in. My costs are sunk and all that. Like as soon as I realize that I shouldn't have engaged at all, I feel like it would be embarassing to admit that and change my behavior. Even if it's embarassing to me, it's still the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>Naming my struggles with letting things go is the first step to letting them go. The second step is action plans, and those action plans are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Paying attention to my emotions more, even when they're positive.</p></li>
            <li><p>Take my ADHD medication more regularly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Admit when I make mistakes as soon as I realize it, but wait to apologize until after I understand.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <summary>Close-Mindedness</summary>
        <p>There are so many angles to think about the world. I am limited to the angles I have access to. My perspectives are informed by my background, and often I am not open to other perspectives.</p>

        <p>It is crucial to point out that because I have many priviledges, closing myself off to other perspectives is actively harmful to those at the lower ends of power dynamics I participate in. I have definitely thought about this context before, but it's not where I struggle most in my opinion.</p>

        <p>In political discussions, I am sometimes unable to tell the difference between "these opinions are harming me" and "these opinions are different from mine." In person it's easier for me to acknowledge the flesh and blood of those I speak to. This makes me more careful, but online it's really hard to not see a disagreement as a type of bigotry I need to fight.</p>

        <p>There are absolutely times when people need to be called out. But as soon as it becomes performative, it does no good. If a disagreement harms nobody, it is not my place to escalate the conversation.</p>

        <p>Cognatively, I am aware that differing perspectives are valuable and good to have, but I don't think my amygdala has figured that out yet. I think my amygdala is prone to act up very easily, especially when I'm off my ADHD medication.</p>

        <p>So what do I do to get better? Well, I think I already have been, passively. I think there are more mild approaches that I can apply broadly over a direct callout. The rabbinic approach of asking questions seem useful. Instead of disagreeing, I can ask questions. Though I have already been doing this. I don't know what I can work on changing that can help me improve myself here.</p>

    <summary id="apr-21">severance (April 21th)</summary>

    <p>Okay idk if anyone even cares but I want to write down my theory for severance. At the time of writing I'm almost done with the second to last episode of the season. But I think I figured it out, and I want to write it down now so later if it turns out I was right I have proof. Do not open the box below unless you have watched the show. Pirate it if you need to.</p>

      <summary>SPOILERS</summary>

      <p>okay so okay okay so uhh</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>What are they even doing?</strong> So those numbers, right? They represent memories of the outies. They are decoding the human brain. There are still some connections between the innie and outie, but innies can only experience the memories of outies through ways that are impossible for them to interpret, i.e. some numbers. The scary numbers represent scary memories, etc, maybe.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>What's Cold Harbor?</strong></p> This is a very important memory that Mark and Gemma share. They are using it to rebuild the scenario to test to see if it triggers a switch or a leech of memories.<</li>
        <li><p><strong>Okay so Gemma though. Like what are they doing?</strong> So this is Lumon's big plan. They want to offer severance as a product to the general public. Get an innie to experience something you don't like doing. Only enjoy the parts of life you want to. Every time you have to suffer, you can switch someone else in, someone who's entire life will be experiencing the same suffering, over and over again. This is why the different Gemmas can't remember anything except for being in their own rooms. She's the test subject.</p></li>
        <li><p>Why her?</p> I don't know yet. They faked her death and imprisoned her, we can tell that much, but why her specifically is completely unclear to us in my opinion. At least, where I am now in the episode. Oh well.</li>
        <li><p>Oh also the guys tasked with fabricating objects? They're making things that Mark decoded through the memories to be used in the rooms for Gemma; but that should be obvious right?</p></li>
      </ol>

    <br>

    <p>Okay those are my dranged ramblings. If any of this is true, that's awesome. If not, then I would love to know what it is that they did instead, because surely it'd be more interesting, right?</p>
