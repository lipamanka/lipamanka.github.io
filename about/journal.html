    <summary id="apr-17">Self Improvement (April 17th)</summary>

    <p>It's what it says on the tin. This journal is supposed to document my self-improvement, for all to see, if you can find it. I think my self-esteem is strong enough that if I were to list my flaws, I wouldn't feel terrible about myself. Especially if I frame it from the perspective of self improvement. So here goes.</p>

        <summary>Letting Things Go</summary>
        <p>I've always struggled with this. In middle school, my science teacher told me to pick my battles, and I didn't get it. Why can't I fight? Why can't I do everything? I'm still figuring out the answers to those questions, but no matter what they are, I know that to be kind to others is to take a step back and focus on something else.</p>

        <p>Even if after the fact I can identify when I've acted like this, I have been unable to identify these feelings in the moment. At my first job at age 17, I got into an argument with a camper over something that I can now recognize as inconsequential. But in the moment, it felt like the right thing to argue, to engage, even though I was right and he was wrong.</p>

        <p>Even today, I interrupted a huge rehearsal to argue with my choral director. I should not have done that, but in the moment it felt like the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>In most cases where I have failed to let things go, I have been technically correct. But that doesn't mean arguing about the thing is important. Looking at things big picture will help me process my response. Noticing emotions escalating will help me prevent them from getting worse.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I feel like I'm too far in. My costs are sunk and all that. Like as soon as I realize that I shouldn't have engaged at all, I feel like it would be embarassing to admit that and change my behavior. Even if it's embarassing to me, it's still the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>Naming my struggles with letting things go is the first step to letting them go. The second step is action plans, and those action plans are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Paying attention to my emotions more, even when they're positive.</p></li>
            <li><p>Take my ADHD medication more regularly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Admit when I make mistakes as soon as I realize it, but wait to apologize until after I understand.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <summary>Close-Mindedness</summary>
        <p>There are so many angles to think about the world. I am limited to the angles I have access to. My perspectives are informed by my background, and often I am not open to other perspectives.</p>

        <p>It is crucial to point out that because I have many priviledges, closing myself off to other perspectives is actively harmful to those at the lower ends of power dynamics I participate in. I have definitely thought about this context before, but it's not where I struggle most in my opinion.</p>

        <p>In political discussions, I am sometimes unable to tell the difference between "these opinions are harming me" and "these opinions are different from mine." In person it's easier for me to acknowledge the flesh and blood of those I speak to. This makes me more careful, but online it's really hard to not see a disagreement as a type of bigotry I need to fight.</p>

        <p>There are absolutely times when people need to be called out. But as soon as it becomes performative, it does no good. If a disagreement harms nobody, it is not my place to escalate the conversation.</p>

        <p>Cognatively, I am aware that differing perspectives are valuable and good to have, but I don't think my amygdala has figured that out yet. I think my amygdala is prone to act up very easily, especially when I'm off my ADHD medication.</p>

        <p>So what do I do to get better? Well, I think I already have been, passively. I think there are more mild approaches that I can apply broadly over a direct callout. The rabbinic approach of asking questions seem useful. Instead of disagreeing, I can ask questions. Though I have already been doing this. I don't know what I can work on changing that can help me improve myself here.</p>

    <p>That's about all I can think of right now. I am going to sleep now, good night. I'll write more next time I feel like it.</p>

    <summary id="apr-22">Bragging (April 22nd)</summary>
    <p>So like. When I was in middle school, I joined a scout troop. This wasn't boy scouts, this was Baden-Powell scouts, which has been unisex for over a century I think? But besides that it was basically boy scouts. And there was a girl in my troop who called me out on my bullshit, and I am forever thankful to her. She changed the way I act on a fundemental level.</p>

    <p>She was always calm and collected, observing. We would meet once weekly in Prospect Park, and she'd always be there, watching. She spoke a lot too, but not too much. Not like me.</p>

    <p>Then one day, she said to me, plainly, "lipamanka, you're so braggy. You need to stop bragging. It's really annoying."</p>

    <p>I felt devistated. I have always been sensitive to rejection, and this hit me like a sack of steel shovels. But I didn't express this sensitivity outwards. I didn't lash out. I spent the rest of the day listening. And I think I grew from that.</p>

    <p>A couple of years later, I was on the way home from my father's parent's house, with my parents, and we were giving a family friend a ride home as well. I wanted to talk to her about high school, because I was about to start. Perhaps it was uncharacteristic of me, but I asked her for advice on how to make friends.</p>

    <p>Without skipping a beat, she answered. "Questions. Questions, questions, questions. You just have to ask questions to everyone you meet. Don't bring up facts about yourself, only ask questions about them. If they answer your questions, they're an acquaintence. If they ask you about yourself, you've just made a friend."</p>

    <p>Sometimes I forget about this wisdom, but I try to live my life by it. If she ever dies, I'll tell this story at her funeral. I still see her at least three times a year, if not more frequently. We're close enough that I'd be invited, at least. Of course, that's morbid, but how can we afford to forget death when it is at the end of all life?</p>

    <p>Recently, I've been interacting with some people who brag a lot. It's brought out the bragger from the midst of myself, for behold, it is in my nature. But I don't like being like this. Every time I see myself brag, I can do little to stop it. It feels like I've gone so long without bragging that I deserve some time to brag, just this once. It's a treat. I've earned it by asking questions. And no, absolutely not; bragging is not a gift from anyone else to me. Bragging is something I do, and it is not a likable thing to do, so I should stop. It doesn't even feel good. It's just a reflex.</p>

    <p>So what am I to do? I don't want to cut braggers out of my life, but if I don't figure out something else, I'll soon become a bragger once again. This is not something I wish to happen.</p>

    <summary id="apr-28">Forgiveness and Friendsmaxxing (Apr 28)</summary>
    <p>Even if I'm able to get better and regain semblence of repport within specific communities that I have been a bad actor in, I don't want to forgive certain people. And I don't have to. There are some people who I think are genuinely not good and I don't like them.</p>

    <p>I need to get my feelings down so I can go to sleep, so here goes.</p>

    <p>Friendsmaxxing is the process by which someone caters the way they interact with people to try to get people to like them. I don't think it's very effective if done alone. Friendmaxxers will pay attention to what behavior makes people like them more, what gets them more status, etc, and do that. They will not feel kinly emotions during interactions. None of this is a bad thing on its own, but it becomes a bad thing when they mascarade as people who are interacting without friendsmaxxing.</p>

    <p>A friendsmaxxer may, in addition to this, attempt to act in such a way to make the other party feel like there is a genuine social connection, even when there is not. When this is the primary way people interact with others, it becomes malicious people-pleasing.</p>

    <p>There are multiple people who do this. I don't need to forgive them, and I won't. I don't really care what's going up there but if you can't have a normal human connection with me with emotions and also pretend to be having normal human connections with me with emotions, then I cannot justify being friends with you.</p>

    <p>I am being careful here to exclude those with cluster B personality disorders from this. Such people are often fantastic apologizers and expertly explain their personality disorders and how they affect communication. If an antisocial person tells me that they don't feel empathy, but are still looking for a connection, I am happy to oblidge. If someone without any antisocial traits tricks me into being their friend through decite, they have committed a transgression against me.</p>

    <p>So while I will improve and become better in every way I need to, I am under no obligation to forgive the people who have tried to friendmax me, the people who thought it was an okay thing to do to pull together a long document listing all of my social flaws, the people who held their power over me while still trying to glean friendship from me. That fucking sucks.</p>

    <summary id="jun-15">Blocking People Back (Jun 15)</summary>
    <p>A while back, in maybe 2020, I got blocked for the first time on social networking. This was only a couple of years after I got my first social networking account, and up until that point I had only used it to keep in touch with some people I knew offline, including some high school friends.</p>

    <p>I was 16.</p>

    <p>The way it made me feel was so intense that I had to DO something. There was too much energy built up inside me. Deep down I knew that they had blocked me because I was an annoying baby teenager on the internet. But I wasn’t mature enough to see that.</p>

    <p>So I blocked them back. My exclusive reason for blocking them was that they blocked me. They, without doubt, had much better reasons to block me. It was very one sided. I WANTED to interact more with them.</p>

    <p>Now I know that is a very immature reason to block someone, and as a policy, I do not block people back if my only reason to do so is that they blocked me.</p>

    <p>What about when someone blocks ME back? Well. Very often, it kind of confirms why I blocked them in the first place. And I should clarify: this is all on discord, where blocking someone doesn’t do much. The only way you could tell until recently that someone was blocking you was that if you tried to react with an emoji on someone’s post, the screen would shake violently and it wouldn’t work.</p>

    <p>Someone blocked me back recently, directly after I blocked them, and I realized all of this. I realized that it’s a maturity thing.</p>

    <summary id="jun-16">Apathy</summary>
    <p>I have become more apathetic to things that I used to care about. Why?.</p>

    <p>I hold very strong opinions. Even so, I can change my mind very easily. It's like a heavy lock. Once you start locking, the mechanism itself pulls your hand into a new position, and only then can you switch back. And it happens so quickly.</p>

    <p>Recently I have begun to not care about how toki pona is used, about what other people get out of it, about the size of the lexicon, etc. I have become apathetic to it because in the past, passion and impulsivity have reacted like gas and ignition. I ended up publically fighting a lot, and I wanted a way to stop.</p>

    <p>Apathy is one of the tools I've been using to be less abraisive. If I convince myself that I don't care about something, I won't get into fights. The passion goes away. But this isn't a bad thing, and I'll explain why.</p>

    <p>For me, there are two types of passion: positive and negative. Negative passion is where my love for something manifests as a hatred for how others interact with it. I must know more than them about these things, and therefore it's my place to educate them. This... sucks. I hate doing it so much.</p>

    <p>Positive passion is when I direct my love for something into supporting and encouraging people who engage with that thing. This is far better, but channeling all of my passion takes concentration and dicipline, and I am too impulsive to know for sure that I won't slip back into negative passion.</p>

    <p>I want to be less opinionated, and it seems the only way for me to be that way is to identify strongly with apathy, which I'm beginning to do quite a bit. Apathy towards how others engage in my passions. Obviously I'm not always right, but perhaps, even when I am right for me, maybe I'm not right for other people.</p>

    <p>One thing I've realized in all of this is that I don't need a reason to dislike something or somebody, and if I can't articulate one in very fashion, I shouldn't try to sway the opinions of others. People should form their own opinions about things. I must only ever share things I've noticed without putting judgement on them. If another party hears what I notice and comes to dislike the thing I dislike, so be it, and if not, it is what it is. </p>

    <summary id="jun-17">Unsolicited Advice and Learning from the Mistakes of Others</summary>

    <p>I repeat negative behaviors until I see someone else doing them, and then I stop, not directly because the behavior is bad, but because I'm better than the other person. Of course, through this process, I DO come to realize that the behavior is bad, so I think this is a good thing overall. I'm not sure why that's the best method by which I can improve.</p>

    <p>Maybe it lets me dissociate and see myself from outside, but with a clear head, with sharp eyes, without the usual fog. And most recently, I was on the recieving end of one of my past flaws: unsolicited advice.</p>

    <p>Mansplaining. Patriarchal overexplaining. Nitpicking. Reply-guy-ism. Public criticism. It's called a lot of things. But, whenever it happens to me, I want nothing more than to say "leave me alone." But especially when I've asked someone to stop interacting with me and they still seek me out and try to interact with me anyway, I've realized that this is something I do, too.</p>

    <p>I do it a lot. Too much.</p>

    <p>And now that I've been hurt by it, I can grow out of it. That's kind of fucked up.</p>

    <summary id="jun-18">Intense Jealousy</summary>

    <p>This one is kind of embarrasing. idk if it's a personality disorder or something like that but I get very jealous very easily, and when I do, I get terrible physical anxiety symptoms. Pain in the chest, lightheadedness, nausea, palpatations, the works.</p>

    <p>This is the real reason I don't know what my IQ is. I know that if I find out, I'll compare myself to others nonstop and feel terrible. I can go check right now. I have the document downloaded on my computer. But I refuse to, because I know better.</p>

    <p>Frequently, I get jealous over musical ability. Which is crazy. I'm like, decent at music. But when I talk to someone who gets to do more prestegious music stuff than I do, or can sing higher than me, or who can a nicer tone or something, or someone who practices more than me, I feel really really shitty. I shouldn't feel this way, it doesn't serve me at all.</p>

    <p>So what the hell do I do about it.</p>

    <summary id="jun-22">Trying to be someone else</summary>

    <p>Sometimes I can't tell who I am or what I am. And I think it's because both of those things can change so easily. I've no idea who I've become, but I hope it's someone better than I was before. </p>
