  <h2 id="resources">toki pona learning resources</h2>
    <p><a href="https://tokipona.org/">Toki Pona: The Language of Good by Sonja Lang</a> Even though it costs money, this course is one of the best and is highly recommended, and it's also written by Sonja Lang herself.</p>
    <p><a href="https://sowelitesa.kittycat.homes/lipu-sona/">lipu sona</a> This site is my personal favorite course for learning toki pona. I always recommend it to new learners. I like it aesthetically and all of the information in it is trustworthy.</p>
    <p><a href="https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/">lipu sona pona</a> This course is consistently reliable and has been recommended by many speakers for a long time. </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki">nasin toki pona</a> This isn't a course, but it's a great resource if a detailed descriptive grammar helps you learn. This resource describes the grammar of toki pona in depth.</p>

  <h2 id="about">about me</h2>
    <p>Howdy do, my name is lipamanka. My prefered head noun is "akesi," mostly becuase it vibes the hardest with me. I'm a tokiponist. I'm nonbinary (they/them) and aroace. I'm a college student studying linguistics. Things I enjoy: toki pona, linguistics, music, chilling, weasels (sometimes I like weasels way too much), cooking. Things I don't like: doxxing myself, loud noises, bigotry, paperwork. I have in the past worked in the board game industry. I'm available on discord (lipamanka#2222) and my email adress is simply my name (lipamanka) at gmail.com.</p>
    <p>I've been involved in a lot of toki pona projects. I moderate the <a href=https://discord.gg/ChC6qtVsSE>kama sona discord server (this is an invite link! beware!)</a>. I created the font <a href="https://wyub.github.io/tokipona/linjasike">linja sike</a>. I founded a discord server deticated to sitelen pona and typography surrounding it called <a href="https://discord.gg/PxqKHE9bwa">ma pi nasin sitelen (discord link!)</a>. I am one of the three people who designed the official sitelen pona glyph for the toki pona word "ku." That's about all my major toki pona involvement. I've gotten semi-invested in lots of smaller projects that aren't worth listing here. Two years of nonstop toki pona'll do that to ya!</p>

Special thanks also goes to <strong>jan Kita</strong> who helped teach me how to set up this website when I was starting off and continues to offer relevant advice. Special thanks also to <strong>jan Kekan San</strong> for letting me use his Dall-e 2 tokens to generate the image that I use for this site's metadata!</p>

<h2 id="statistics">statistics</h2>
    <p>This is where I collect my findings about toki ponists using the sona kulupu channel that I made in ma pona pi toki pona, or by speculating or estimating lol. When I say "toki ponists" in the following statistics, I am talking about the limited and biased sample size of people on ma pona pi toki pona. I'm not willing to go into more effort to make this data better though so enjoy some motherfucking statistics:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>51/68 of toki ponists who have an opinion one way or the otherlike jeans</li>
      <li>there are a lot of trans toki ponists</li>
    </ol>
