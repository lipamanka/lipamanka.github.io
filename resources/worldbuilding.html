    <summary>About:</summary>
    <p>One day (that day being April 9th, 2025), I sat down and decided to write as many worldbuilding prompts for a constructed culture as I could By the following day, I had 101 worldbuilding prompts. I will continue to add prompts as I think of them. More information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>The prompts are stored <a href="./prompts.txt">here</a>. Feel free to take a look. Conlang prompts are stored <a href="./clong-prompts.txt">here</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Feel free to reinterpret any prompt in any way to better fit your setting. If something doesn't fit, you can always click the button again.</p></li>
        <li><p>If your culture has their own language, I recommend thinking about what words they use to talk about things.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you want, you can copy and paste all of the prompts into a spreadsheet and answer them one by one. If you do this, I recommend randomizing the order or organizing them in a new way that makes sense to you.</p></li>
        <li><p>All prompts are added to the text file in the order I come up with them.</p></li>
        <li><p>All prompts are subject to change.</p></li>
        <li><p>This page wouldn't be possible without coding help from <a href="https://dan.onl/">ilo Tani</a>. ilo Tani is one of the coolest toki ponists out there right now and is also just a wonderful person to interact with?? Like how can one person be this good and cool and awesome?</p></li>
        <li><p>The contents of <a href="./prompts.txt">https://lipamanka.gay/resources/prompts.txt</a> and <a href="./clong-prompts.txt">https://lipamanka.gay/resources/clong-prompts.txt</a>are released under CC-0. You can use it for practically anything you want. You could even sell it! idk who would buy it, because it's available free online, but whatever!</p></li>
        <li><p>No AI was used in the creation of these prompts. If you thought AI was used, I'm both flattered and offended.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The current number of culture prompts is 142</strong></p></li>
