What terms do speakers use to refer to family members? Are maternal family members and paternal family members called by the same words? Are people of different genders called different terms? If so, are these different roots, or inflected versions of the same root?
How are causatives derived? i.e. how do you make someone do something? Is a word for "throw" a causative of a word for "move," or its own base root? What about other similar words that could swing either way? 
Do any consonants change intervocalically? At the end of words? At the beginnings of words? How much sense does this change make crosslinguistically?
When an event is performed habitually, how may speakers describe it differently? How would one translate "He has been known to dance" and distinguish it from "He danced"? Is this a grammatical feature? (It doesn't have to be!)
How do neologisms function? Do speakers reuse words they already have? Do they loan new words? Do speakers ever coin words? Who coins them? Are there any rules for clippings? Are there any rules for compounding? How often is onomatopoeia used?
