    <h2 id="a-prose-dictionary-for-toki-pona">A Prose Dictionary For toki pona</h2>
    <h7 id="by-lipamanka">by lipamanka</h7>

    <p>In Summer, 2021, Sonja Lang released the official Toki Pona Dictionary. To this day, it serves as a reasonable list of ideas from which Toki Pona learners can take inspiration. Unfortunately, the information it contains is opaque. This is because there is no prose to elaborate on the ideas. There is no explanation for why a phrase may work. There is no instruction on how to form compounds. And perhaps most importantly, there are no calls to explore semantic spaces.</p>

    <p>This is similar to my toki pona semantic spaces dictionary, but it will work in the reverse, kind of. It will still be in English, save for examples, but it will introduce English words and phrases and Anglophone concepts, and describe their semantic spaces in terms of toki pona words. <strong>In essence, this prose dictionary is a collection of examples of breaking down complex concepts into their core components.</strong></p>

    <p>There will also be further information on the lexicon of toki pona, including what a lexical entry is, and how toki pona maintains a small lexicon. This dictionary will be largely descriptive, but because of the nature of toki pona and creativity, I will encourage a great deal of exploration as well, only remarking on how likely something is to be understood.</p>

    <p>I will also go over toki pona’s zero derivation system, also known as the “parts of speech analysis,” because it comes up a lot, it is relatively difficult to explain on the fly, and I think it has the potential to be useful to some learners.</p>

    <p>As always, this is a living document, and I may change and add entries as I go. I will likely skip over most super obvious words. For example, according to <a href="https://frequencylist.com/">https://frequencylist.com/</a>", “say” is the 46th most common word in English. At least for the time being, I will assume that a reader can figure out on their own that the toki pona word for “say” is “toki.”</p>

    <p>Note that this document does not shun the usage of any word proposal. Many entries here will match up pretty well with the semantic space of a non-pu word without mentioning that word at all. This in no way means you cannot use such a word. It just offers a way to not use it. In many cases, choosing to use fewer words, even for a little while as a challenge, will lead to a deeper understanding of the concepts behind them.</p>
    
    <h3 id="how-to-use-this">How to use this</h3>

    <p>It’s literally so simple. If you have an English word, simply ctrl+F (windows) or command+F (mac) and type it in. Your browser will find the English word, and it will show you a section of the dictionary that elaborates on or expands on that concept.</p>

    <p>If you can’t find the English word you’re looking for, there are a few possibilities:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>I missed a keyword, but there is an entry that fits it</p></li>
        <li><p>There is no entry for this concept</p></li>
        <li><p>you added too many suffixes or prefixes.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the first one, LET ME KNOW ON DISCORD AT LIPAMANKA. or my email. lipamanka at gmail dot com. or on bluesky! at lipamanka dot gay. Those are the three places to reach me. I will add it posthaste!</p>

    <p>If the second one, let me know anyway and I will consider adding it.</p>

    <p>If the third one, remove suffixes and prefixes until you have the root of the word. You may have an easier time finding it.</p>

    <h3 id="wip">This is a Work In Progress</h3>

    <p>So far I have only includend a few prevelant entries. I will be adding more in the coming weeks. Please enjoy what I have already!</p>

        </details>

        <p>In order to best understand how to talk about opposites in toki pona, we must acknowledge that for the meanings of words, there are no true opposites, in any language. This is especially true for toki pona, where most “opposite” words will diverge in usage in some specific way that is hard to call an opposite meaning.</p>

        <p>What is the opposite of a chair? There’s no good answer. What is the opposite of joy? Anger? Grief? Fear? There are too many good answers. The only case where an opposite is “real” is something directional. If we have a direction, we can find the opposite direction by turning 180 degrees. This is easy enough in most cases.</p>

        <p>If we are talking about the opposite side of a river or train tracks, we can say “poka ante.” We can even use “esun” here for “cross over,” framing the act as some sort of trading of sides. If we need to make a U-turn and head in the opposite direction, we can describe the act as a change of mind (wile li kama ante), a realization of a mistake (mi kama sona e ni: mi tawa nasin pakala), or we can simply use kama and weka as opposites (mi kama li weka).</p>

        <p>You can also use utala. The act itself of opposing things is an utala, and if opposites are fighting, you can use “utala” to describe that relationship, like opposite sides of a debate. You can even use utala to frame situations like this, which can be a very interesting take on opposites.</p>

        <p>But sometimes, there will be no good way to talk about a specific opposite relationship in toki pona. If you’re struggling, it may be best to approach the concept without trying to frame it as an opposite at all.</p>

            <p>reflection, mirror, refraction, mirrored, copied, reflect, mirror, reverberate</p>
        </details>

        <p>For reflective surfaces, the first thing I go for is usually the material, and its orientation. If I’m looking at my reflection in a mirror, I may use kiwen or sinpin. If I’m looking in a still pond, I may use telo. Then I say that I can see myself in whatever the surface is. I often find myself using pana here, saying that the surface gives me to my eyes. ken la telo li pana e mi tawa lukin mi.</p>

        <p>The general concept of reflecting light and sound is a little harder to pin down, though. I’ve listed some examples below that are semi-exhaustive of ways to do this, but it really comes down to breaking down the act of reflecting into two instances: something else shining light on the object, and the object emitting light afterwards. This is more or less the science of what happens! You can also use “weka” to describe the act of getting rid of light instead of absorbing it.</p>

        <details open>
            <summary>Examples</summary>
            <ul>
                <li><p>mi suno e kiwen la kiwen li pana e suno lili | This rock reflects a little light</p></li>
                <li><p>ko ni li weka e suno ike len tan selo | This sunscreen reflects invisible ultraviolet radiation.</p></li>
                <li><p>mi lukin e mi lon telo | I watched my reflection in the water.</p></li>

        </details>

        <p>sama is the most useful word for this. For nearly all of these words, it is probably the most useful word to use. For something like mitosis, “tu” is perhaps better, but most acts of copying include making a new thing to resemble an old thing, not one thing becoming two new things.</p>

        <p>You can also use "sin" transitively. This will usually describe the act of repeating an action that creates something. This may imply some amount of change, which may be different from an exact copy.</p>

            <p>theft, larceny, acquisition, stolen, taken, take, steal, grab, pick up, borrow</p>
        </details>

        <p>There are ultimately two kinds of acquisition: one that removes the object taken, and one that duplicates it. Theft is the former, and copy/paste is the latter. For both of these, “kama jo” as a phrase is pretty useful without specifying. It’s ambiguous.</p>

        <p>weka implies that something is removed. Even if the object is not removed, weka will still frame it as such. So if I copy a joke from someone, and I use weka to describe that, it has a very similar connotation to using the word “steal” to describe that same action in English. It’s a little funny.</p>

        <p>You can use the word “sin” transitively to describe the act of copying something. For our same example with taking a joke from someone, using “sin” here would clarify that you’re just using it again. You can use “sama” as an adjective to describe the thing you're copying.</p>

        <p>See <a href="#copies">the "copies" entry</a> for more information about the "duplicate" sense.</p>

        <p>In English, connections and networks form a conceptual metaphor between physical linking, like that of an electrical wire or bricks stacked upon each other, and metaphysical social connections, like conversations and friendships. English speakers conceptualize these things the same way when operating within an Anglophone mental framework.</p>

        <p>With toki pona, you have two options if you want to be understood. You can either forgo the conceptual metaphor (easy), or lean into it (difficult).</p>

        <p>To forgo it, you need to look at these two senses of the words “connection” and “network” differently, which can be difficult for an English speaker. Luckily, toki pona allows you to treat these concepts differently pretty easily, so I’ll explain how to do that first.</p>

        <p>A physical connection is either when two things touch, or when two things are linked by a different object. When things touch physically, you can use “pilin” to describe the touching. Be careful, though, because it is difficult to use pilin like this for metaphysical things without the meaning changing to “opine.”</p>

        <p>When things are linked by a different object, that linking object is often a “linja.” I used to sail a lot, and most things on the boat that were connected to other things were connected using various ropes. In fact, the sailing word for rope is “line.” Note that this is not the same thing as using the word “linja” to “mean” the english word “connect” or “connection.” It is just often useful in creating imagery for a description.</p>

        <p>Another way to help conceptualize why this Anglophone conceptual metaphor doesn't make its way into toki pona is looking at another object that connects things: glue. Glue is a type of ko (or kiwen, once hardened), and what it does is a type of awen. But in English, we don't associate the word "connect” with glue, so to us, it doesn't make as much sense as "linja.” Do not fall into the trap of using linja! I consider this a calque.</p>

        <p>As for the less physical meaning, I find myself immediately reaching for “wan.” It can refer to acts of uniting, and a lot of “connections” are just unions of things. For example, I connect with my family when I unite with them, however that may manifest.</p>

        <p>Often, a “connection” is a type of toki! This is a great example of a place where English uses one word for a lot of different concepts. To connect with someone is to communicate with them.</p>

        <p>There are times when we say things are “connected,” which can mean that they are similar concepts, share some features in common, have interacted, do interact, or will interact, or any number of other things. This is one of the cases where, if you’re trying to translate into toki pona, it’s best to rephrase first, or try to conceptualize within toki pona, without using English as training wheels. It just means so many things!</p>

        <p>Furthermore, I feel that half of the time, when I hear that things are connected, the person who claimed such is unable to elaborate on how that is the case. I think there’s a reason why conspiracy theorists don’t learn toki pona. It’s hard to say “it’s all connected” without saying what you mean by that.</p>

        <p>And a network is just a lot of connections. Whatever toki pona word you’d use to describe a single connection in a network is likely apt in a construction for describing the whole thing. You can also easily use “kulupu” to describe the grouping of connections.</p>

        <p>If you’d like to lean into the conceptual metaphor present in English, you need to describe the metaphor. It still may be difficult to understand, and it will consistently be longer than an alternative. But it can work! See below for an example, but you will need to be creative.</p>

        </details>

        <p>The word I use for some sort of middle ground between two extremes is “insa.” It has an underexplored metaphysical meaning. People usually know it as “center” or “inside” or “internal part,” but it can also mean “space between,” which can be extended to mean “quality between.” So, if you have two extremes and want to say that something is right in the middle, insa is the word to use.</p>

        <p>But it’s not quite that easy, because you don’t know what insa is the insa of! Generally I use constructions with la. See below for examples of that.</p>

        <p>You can also say that something is neither of the extremes. What’s left? The middle ground. So you can say that something is neither seli nor lete. Then the listener knows that that thing is lukewarm, or a different temperature that makes more sense in context.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I combine these two methods!</p>

        <p>You can also say that something is “normal,” which can be “nasin” or “nasa ala,” depending on what makes the most sense. These are especially useful to use transitively to mean “normalize.” nasin can mean “status quo,” and nasa can be a deviation from that, so these are useful too.</p>
