    <h2 id="a-prose-dictionary-for-toki-pona">A Prose Dictionary For toki pona</h2>
    <h7 id="by-lipamanka">by lipamank</h7>

    <p>In Summer, 2021, Sonja Lang released the official Toki Pona Dictionary. To this day, it serves as a reasonable list of ideas from which Toki Pona learners can take inspiration. Unfortunately, the information it contains is opaque. This is because there is no prose to elaborate on the ideas. There is no explanation for why a phrase may work. There is no instruction on how to form compounds. And perhaps most importantly, there are no calls to explore semantic spaces.</p>

    <p>This is similar to my toki pona semantic spaces dictionary, but it will work in the reverse, kind of. It will still be in English, save for examples, but it will introduce English words and phrases and Anglophone concepts, and describe their semantic spaces in terms of toki pona words. <strong>In essence, this prose dictionary is a collection of examples of breaking down complex concepts into their core components.</strong></p>

    <p>There will also be further information on the lexicon of toki pona, including what a lexical entry is, and how toki pona maintains a small lexicon. This dictionary will be largely descriptive, but because of the nature of toki pona and creativity, I will encourage a great deal of exploration as well, only remarking on how likely something is to be understood.</p>

    <p>I will also go over toki pona’s zero derivation system, also known as the “parts of speech analysis,” because it comes up a lot, it is relatively difficult to explain on the fly, and I think it has the potential to be useful to some learners.</p>

    <p>As always, this is a living document, and I may change and add entries as I go. I will likely skip over most super obvious words. For example, according to <a href="https://frequencylist.com/">https://frequencylist.com/</a>", “say” is the 46th most common word in English. At least for the time being, I will assume that a reader can figure out on their own that the toki pona word for “say” is “toki.”</p>

    <p>Note that this document does not shun the usage of any word proposal. Many entries here will match up pretty well with the semantic space of a non-pu word without mentioning that word at all. This in no way means you cannot use such a word. It just offers a way to not use it. In many cases, choosing to use fewer words, even for a little while as a challenge, will lead to a deeper understanding of the concepts behind them.</p>
    
    <h3 id="how-to-use-this">How to use this</h3>

    <p>It’s literally so simple. If you have an English word, simply ctrl+F (windows) or command+F (mac) and type it in. Your browser will find the English word, and it will show you a section of the dictionary that elaborates on or expands on that concept.</p>

    <p>If you can’t find the English word you’re looking for, there are a few possibilities:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>I missed a keyword, but there is an entry that fits it</p></li>
        <li><p>There is no entry for this concept</p></li>
        <li><p>you added too many suffixes or prefixes.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the first one, LET ME KNOW ON DISCORD AT LIPAMANKA. or my email. lipamanka at gmail dot com. or on bluesky! at lipamanka dot gay. Those are the three places to reach me. I will add it posthaste!</p>

    <p>If the second one, let me know anyway and I will consider adding it.</p>

    <p>If the third one, remove suffixes and prefixes until you have the root of the word. You may have an easier time finding it.</p>

    <h3 id="wip">This is a Work In Progress</h3>

    <p>So far I have only includend a few prevelant entries. I will be adding more in the coming weeks. Please enjoy what I have already!</p>

        <p>In order to best understand how to talk about opposites in toki pona, we must acknowledge that for the meanings of words, there are no true opposites, in any language. This is especially true for toki pona, where most “opposite” words will diverge in usage in some specific way that is hard to call an opposite meaning.</p>

        <p>What is the opposite of a chair? There’s no good answer. What is the opposite of joy? Anger? Grief? Fear? There are too many good answers. The only case where an opposite is “real” is something directional. If we have a direction, we can find the opposite direction by turning 180 degrees. This is easy enough in most cases.</p>

        <p>If we are talking about the opposite side of a river or train tracks, we can say “poka ante.” We can even use “esun” here for “cross over,” framing the act as some sort of trading of sides. If we need to make a U-turn and head in the opposite direction, we can describe the act as a change of mind (wile li kama ante), a realization of a mistake (mi kama sona e ni: mi tawa nasin pakala), or we can simply use kama and weka as opposites (mi kama li weka).</p>

        <p>You can also use utala. The act itself of opposing things is an utala, and if opposites are fighting, you can use “utala” to describe that relationship, like opposite sides of a debate. You can even use utala to frame situations like this, which can be a very interesting take on opposites.</p>

        <p>But sometimes, there will be no good way to talk about a specific opposite relationship in toki pona. If you’re struggling, it may be best to approach the concept without trying to frame it as an opposite at all.</p>

            <p>mi utala e sina | We’re on opposite sides of this war.</p>

            <p>kiwen ni li jo e poka tu. poka li nasin ante la ona li wile kama lon poka. | For these magnets, opposites attract!</p>
