<p>HELLO I’mm a fucking weasel and I’m here to talk about why weasels are AMAZING okay so</p>
<p>first of all I wanna talk about <em>running around in circles</em> right so weasels do this all the time and it’s the BEST like you should look it up on the internet “weasels running around in circles” uwu second of all like imagine a weasel running around in a circle in your mind. some weasels (including me) do this (running around inside people’s minds) it’s pretty cool and it feels great</p>

<h3 id="now-for-a-more-serious-note">now for a more serious note</h3>
<p>I want to talk about the stigma around being  FUCKING WEASEL. Unfortunately, there are systemic trends of people associating harmful stereotypes with weasels, including being shnivvling kniving evil beings that are sneaky and will cheat you out of your money and have bad political opinions. These misconseptions are bad and harm the weasel community.</p>
