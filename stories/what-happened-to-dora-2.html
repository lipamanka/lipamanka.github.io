        <summary id="recap">Recap (Oct 15 2024)</summary>

        <p>Here is a quick synopsis of what has happened so far.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>I found a very old book written in Biblical Hebrew. With it was a notebook written in cursive yiddish detailing instructions on how to open a gateway to another world, written by my great great aunt, Dora Lipman.</p></li>
            <li><p>I successfully opened a gateway to Qwamaqqar, the land of the Qwamaq people. The portal opened into a small farming village called Matar.</p></li>
            <li><p>I started to collect language samples and analyze their language while getting to know them better.</p></li>
            <li><p>Zhoniker ("walker") is a songwalker who lives with his mother Uqumer ("woodworker") and his grandmother Akakiper (a reduplicated version of the word for "rock"). They also raise two children together named Usalamaper ("tree-climber") and Ripiper ("trickster").</p></li>
            <li><p>Zhoniker, Uqumer, and Akakiper told me that Akakiper used to be well acquainted with Dora Lipman, who showed up in this world a very long time ago.</p></li>
            <li><p>The Oriti are an ethnic group from a different place who are occupying most of eastern Qwamaq land. They do not treat the Qwamaq well and do not let non-Oriti people enter and leave their capital city, which the Qwamaq call "Oritshipar"</p></li>
            <li><p>At least a few decades ago, Dora moved to Oritshipar BEFORE Oriti occupation, and the Oriti occupation began while she was still living there. Nobody knows what happened to Dora, but  she probably wasn't allowed to leave Oritshipar.</p></li>
            <li><p>Akakiper told me that in order to find out what happened to Dora, I needed to visit the city Konoprar (/konopr/ means "to rise," so the city's name would translate to "Rising City." Not sure why yet).</p></li>
        </ul>

        

        <p>It has been several days since my last journal entry. In the meantime, I've completed a full grammar for the Qwamaq language (which can be found <a href="/stories/qwamaq-grammar">here</a>). Going forward I will be writing the Qwamaq with an English translation in parentheses. I have a lot to share soon about what else I've been doing. Stay tuned for Oct 16, 2024!</p>

        <summary id="oct-16">Oct 16 2024 11:15 AM</summary>
        
        <p>By pure chance I found a door just on the ground outside. Here's a picture from when I found it:</p>
        
        <img src="/images/door.jpeg" alt="a door laying against a tree in Saint Paul, Minnesota, not in a door frame" style="width: 100%">
        
        <p>If you don't believe me, try reverse image searching the image. Nothing will come up, because I took that picture!</p>
        
        <p>I've done some experiments using the door and some translation of the Hebrew book. I think I've found out something very interesting about how doors relate to gateways. So I tried using the magic circles on several door-like objects:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Windows! Didn't work at all at first, but if I close my eyes, when I open the windows, they lead to Qwamaqqar. But they usually open into the interiors of cupboards.</p></li>
            <li><p>Naturally, I tried cupboards in my own home next. And drawers. The drawers led to the interior closed pots (and the shape seemed kind of warped? I couldn't test it out because all of my drawers led to pots that were very hot. smelled good tho.) </p></li>
            <li><p>Next I tried making my own small door out of cardboard as a proof of concept. It was about the size of an index card and it opened into the hole in a tree. I kept it open and put it next to my wifi router. I wrapped it in cheesecloth so bugs and stuff couldn't move back and forth freely. If I ever find a hole in a tree with cheesecloth inside of it, I'll see if I can't get Uqumer (who is a woodworker) to remove it from the tree so I can have wifi wherever I go in Qwamaqqar.</p></li>
            <li><p>I tried one of my friend's garage door, and when it opened up, it opened between two trees in the middle of a forest near Matar. The warping I mentioned for the drawers was full swing here. So, if I hypothetically needed to get a vehicle or large animal or something very large through, I could use a garage door.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The only consistency here is that gateways always open to the same places. They seem to be tied together in some VERY hard to decipher network, so I'm not sure how to make sense of it. I've tried drawing maps of where the doors are in both worlds and it doesn't match up 1:1, just by general area, but none of them really make sense. Two doors in my own home open to doors on opposite ends of Matar, which is a large (but very spread out and rural) city. One of the doors in Uqumer's house leads to someone's bathroom in Minneapolis (according to google maps), which is, given, only technically a different city from the one I live in, still different enough that this was surprising to me.</p>
        
        <p>I shouldn't be that surprised though. I don't know why I assumed these gateways would be the same as nether portals lmao.</p>
        
        <p>Then I brought Zhoniker with me to my world for the first time, to help transport the door I found through a gateway. I also showed him my spice collection, which he thought was interesting. Maybe one day I'll sit down with him and Akakiper and see what neologisms* they come up with. The door from my world is resting in Zhoniker's home right now. I have no idea what it'll do because it's not attached to a door frame, but Uqumer has my permission to try doing something with it.</p>
        
        <p>While learning to cook Qwamaq food**, I've talked to Uqumer about transporting the door to their home with the doorframe to Konoprar so I can visit Konoprar, but she seems to be against the idea. At this point in time I think these are my options:<p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Find out somewhere in my world that leads to Konoprar, and visit Konoprar from that location</p></li>
            <li><p>Wait until fall break or winter break and spend my time visiting Konoprar and exploring/sleuthing. (This ideally requires that I've found the wifi cheesecloth treehole by the time fall break starts, and I'm not sure how plausible that is.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Find some doorframe in Matar that leads to another door either in my house, a friend's house, or somewhere on my campus, and transport it physically to Konoprar, or have someone else transport it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Try to decipher the original Hebrew book more and figure out if I can change the location of the gateway somehow.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I don't know which of these I'm going to go for. Option 2 seems the most reliable and simple, but I would have to wait a while. I don't have a car, so option 1 would be difficult. Option 4 seems the hardest, and Option 3 seems potentially too much to ask for Uqumer and Zhoniker. I may run it by Zhoniker but idk.</p>
        
        <p>I also don't know for SURE that moving a doorframe doesn't change where the portal opens up, but once the portal is ALREADY open, I know that the doorframe can be moved around (from the small cardboard one I made).</p>
        
        <p>Not sure where to go from here, but I have been doing more than just playing around with the gateways. I've been spending a lot of time with Zhoniker. He's tattooed me, which means we're in some sort of queerplatonic-esque relationship.</p>
        
        <p>My fall break actually starts tomorrow, and I have until the 21st to finish, so we should probably act fast.</p>

        <summary>*Tangent: Qwamaq Neologisms and Sociolinguistics</summary>
        
            <p>I talked about this in my full grammatical analysis of Qwamaq. the Qwamaq seem to care a LOT about getting neologisms right, and it plays into their social hierarchy (which is based on how many tattoos you have). Here is an excerpt from my grammar:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            
                <p>It should be noted that when it comes to neologisms, it's expected for the member of the group with the most tattoos to decide for the whole group. Whenever I would show something new to the family I've been spending time with, everyone would always look to Akakiper. If she wasn't there, people looked to Uqumer instead, but Uqumer would frequently feel obligated to GO FIND Akakiper to ask her. It's really sweet how much they care about doing neologisms RIGHT. </p>
                
                <p>They actually prioritize getting Akakiper to come up with neologisms over things like tending to food to keep it from burning. One time, Umuqer instructed me to get Ripiper, who was playing outside. (Zhoniker and Usalamaper were off somewhere and I was helping out around the house.) Then, Umuqer asked Ripiper to get Akakiper.</p>
                
                <p>Why she didn't just ask me is beyond me, but it could be because Akakiper is a very respected member of the family and I only had one tattoo at the time, which was faint and covered up on my left shoulder. None of them had ever seen it. So formality-wise, I'm only slightly a rung up from the children, or perhaps even below because I'm not Qwamaq.</p>
            
            </blockquote>

            <summary>**Tangent: Learning Qwamaq cooking</summary>
            
            <p>
            
            <p>Traditional Qwamaq cooking is pretty damn good. Uqumer uses three ingredients in most of her meals, each of which are either definitely in the same genus or cultivars of the same species. The first one, tumpasekiser ("long-fruit"), resembles a banana, but the inside appears drier. The Qwamaq beat it until it turns into a paste, which becomes very moist. They base most of their sauces on this fruit. On its own it barely has any flavor, but it feels very tannic and astringent if consumed without being beaten. It mellows out significantly. I am assuming that this is due to like enzymes or something.</p>
            
            <p>Most cooking starts with some sort of oil. I'm not sure where it comes from, but Uqumer says it comes from a tree far away. Not sure what that means at all, because whenever I ask her to clarify she just repeats "from a tree far away" ("maqoˈmer" /ma-qom-er/ ma is tree and qom is distant). But it's probably plant based? Anyway it's solid at room temperature (similar to ghee or niter kibbeh, but with a neutral flavor) and melts very quickly at body temperature, so it Uqumer usually uses a knife to cut pieces off directly into the pan.</p> 
            
            <p>Then Uqumer usually adds an allium that looks like if fennel was an allium instead of a member of the carrot family. She cuts the root off, allowing multiple… like flat bits? Of the white stuff. Circular but they grow into breen fronds. But she cuts the root off, allowing multiple of those to fall apart and then she cuts off the fronds. She gives them a few coarse chops either way and adds them to the hot oil. She immediately pours over a liquid that I've tasted before. It tastes like really salty salt water, but it also tastes… fermented. Slightly. And umami. Kind of in the same way soy sauce is but completely different. </p>
            
            <p>Once fragrant, she will usually add the second of the three ingredients I mentioned at the beginning, tumpapalaper ("dance-fruit"). This contains either the same or a similar compound to the one found in szechuan peppercorns, because it has the same effect on the tongue. It's what they use to make food taste "spicy" here. They grow small and are red, kind of like chili peppers, but the internal structure is completely different. They're filled with a powder that Uqumer tells me is a pulp before it is dried, and that when it's pulpy it doesn't "make the mouth dance." She also adds some seeds that look similar to cumin or caraway seeds but smell somewhat different.</p>
            
            <p>She then adds the paste from one or two tumpasekiser (the long-fruit), which releases a lot of moisture immediately. It must have some emulsifiers in it because soon the oil is nowhere to be found and the sauce becomes a cohesive mass.</p>
            
            <p>She removes the sauce from the heat and cooks some of the third of the three ingredients I mentioned: tumpamontiper ("wet-fruit"). This is the first thing I ever tasted in Qwamaqqar. It's juicy and savory but also sweet. Uqumer grills it in the oil with a root vegetable and some sort of gourd I don't recognize before adding them directly to the sauce and serving with a squeeze of a citrus that looks like a cross between a lemon and an orange.</p>
            
            <p>This is a pretty typical Qwamaq meal. It's fragrant and well seasoned in every way I can imagine. It's really good! I have no idea how to replicate the recipe yet using stuff from our world, but I assume I'd have to use some sort of starch to create the sauce, and perhaps I would need egg yolk or some other strong emulsifier. I could replace the allium with onion pretty easily, use soy sauce for the liquid, and cook it in coconut oil? maybe? And use banana, squash, and parsnips or carrots or potatoes or all of the above. If I get a chance to try it out I will!</p>

        <p>Zhoniker and I have come up with a plan.</p>

        <p>First, we installed the door I brought from my world in a random doorframe in Matar. (Well; Uqumer made a doorframe for us and put it outside leaning against the wall.) I tested out my gateway magic circle on it and it opened into someone's front door a few blocks down. Luckily, I'm well acquainted with most of my neighbors, and this was one of them. His name is Scott and he grows peppers in his front yard. He's let me take a few of them, and they're very good!</p>

        <p>I showed him how the gateways worked and he gave me the key.</p>

        <p>The next step was moving the doorframe INSIDE Qwamaqqar. Luckily, when we walked with it about a half a mile towards Konoprar, it opened to the same door in Minnesota. So with a little luck, if Zhoniker brings the door with him to Konoprar, I should have access to Konoprar AND Matar without having to travel far in Minnesota.</p>

        <p>I've also found the cheesecloth gateway! It's in a tree growing in Uqumer's backyard. She has graciously been working on making the small gateway portable, i.e. sawing it out of the tree so it can be put a bag. Once she finishes it, I'll see what happens when I bring it through a portal back to Minnesota. I postulate that this will allow me to connect to my home wifi from anywhere, but I don't know if the gateways work once moved into a different world, or what happens if I do this while the gateway is open.</p>

        <p>After we confirmed that the new doorframe worked, Zhoniker told me "aʃaˈsel wokaˈpel fu Konoprar tar qaˈmer paˈpiʃ" (I will bring your door to Konoprar). Something they don't tell you is that doors are HEAVY, but Zhoniker and I can move it together if we take breaks! We are planning on starting this trek tomorrow in the afternoon. I have never slept in Qwamaqqar before, so we'll see how it goes! If I need to, I can return home at any time by opening the door to Scott's house and walking down the block to my home. It's a little jank but we'll have to work with it!</p>

        <p>I don't foresee needing to return home during the journey to Konoprar, but that doesn't really matter too much because Uqumer will be done with the portable cheesecloth gateway by then, and I'll be able to send updates on my way to Konoprar.</p>

        <p>Zhoniker told me "esˈsel fu pompompeler ampar fiŋ Konoprar ˌʃannaˈŋapa" (We will reach Konoprar in two days on foot).</p>

        <p class="note">Note that pompompeler is /poŋ-poŋ-pel-er/. poŋer means "to be a square," and Akakiper has told me that pompoŋer used to mean "eight day cycle" when she was a child, but now just means "day." ʃannaŋapa means "like a string," and it's also used to mean "in single file."</p>

        <p>So we should have arrived by the end of the day on Sunday, and I will be back home in time for classes! I'm very excited to make the trek. I wonder what we'll run into on the way.</p>

        <details closed>
            <summary>More info on how doors and dwellings work in Qwamaq culture</summary>
            
            <p>The Qwamaq word for door is "qamer," which comes from the root "qam," which means "to enter into a home." The interior is "qamel" (with the dative nominalizer), which means the sentence "aʃaˈqam fu qaˈmel tar qaˈmar" means "The door opens into the interior."</p>
            
            <p>The Qwamaq make their homes out of twigs and mud. The land is cold, but the sun is hot, and the air is dry, so mud dries fast and hard. They have little circles drawn all over the house, and Uqumer says that each circle is the home for a small spirit (natal-er) that keeps the home from falling apart. The house that all five people live in belongs to Uqumer, who made it while she was pregnant with Zhoniker. 
            
            The doorway of the dwelling opens down because the house itself is built over a hole in the ground. The hole is piled over with stones. Uqumer showed me the bottom of a few of these stones. Each one has a circle carved into it. The care that goes into creating a dwelling is incredible. The spirits are said to keep the stones clean, though I see Uqumer cleaning them a lot.</p>
            
            <p>The most remarkable thing about these stones is that they fit together perfectly. I couldn't fathom how this happened, so I tried my best to ask using the vocabulary I had:</p>
            
            <p>"ˈtulum akiˌʃulˈper pʼalaŋˈŋapʼa fimol?" (why do all these stones come together so well?)</p>
            
            <p class="note">Note that I'm using ejectives for emphasis. This is technically code switching into "young speech." Also note the infixed ʃul in "akiper." That turns "rock" into "many rocks." If I wanted to emphasize the amount more I could have reduplicated the ʃu part. Uqumer doesn't correct me as much as Zhoniker and Akakiper and the kids do, but Usalamaper was in the same room and they are often zealous about correcting me when is say something weird, so I'm confident that this is a normal enough thing to say.</p>
            
            <p>Uqumer responded by saying "fifi ˈtinus tar nataˈler paˌpakiˈper fu ipiˈper fifi aʃaˈʃaŋŋa ampi tar Zhonike ." (because the spirits of the stones are comfortable because Zhoniker sings to them).</p>
            
            <p>This is actually an idiomatic expression! "tinus fu ipiper" is literally "breath a close thing," but the meaning of the phrase is "to be comfortable in one's surroundings." Also hearing the word "akiper" used to talk about rocks is interesting because that's where Akakiper's name comes from. Note that this sentence starts with "fifi," which means that it is an addendum to my sentence. This is how people normally say "because" in Qwamaq after someone asks "why" (fimol).</p>
            
            <p>So I suppose the rocks changed shape to fit nicely with each other because the spirits in the rocks feel at home. That's really fun! I believe her; I've seen things happen when the spirits get petitioned (the Qwamaq word for petitioning is "kaʃi"), and the floor is remarkably smooth even when the stones have been proven to be separate and cut from different rocks (there are several different colors of stone).</p>

        <p>Greetings! </p>

        <p>It's been less than three hours since I've been in Qwamaqqar on my way to Konoprar and I already have so much to report on. I've divided this entry into parts. </p>

        <h3>Uqumer's Portable Wifi Gateway</h3>

        <p>Uqumer finished making the wifi gateway! It's been really quite incredible. It works like a charm. My phone is connected to the wifi and works perfectly, and I can sit down and use my laptop. I got rid of the cheesecloth on the side of the gateway  in my world and put it on the side of the portal in Qwamaqqar. Then I placed a phone charger and a computer charger (plugged into the wall) right next to it, so I could reach in and pull them through to charge my devices.</p>

        <p>Zhoniker seems really interested in technology. I showed him my web journal but he couldn't read anything. because he can't read the Latin alphabet. But I did show him inkscape and some video games, and he seemed very interested in the video games. Maybe if we have a moment of recreation in the coming days, I can show him something more on the simple side? Let me know if you have tips for games I can show him.</p>

        <h3>The Lore of Zhoniker's Hometown</h3>

        <p>While we were walking, Zhoniker told me about the origin of Matar. Apparently it was named after a large greenhouse. /mat/ means "to grow in a greenhouse." A greenhouse is matʃiqar and matar is "the city where things grow in a greenhouse."</p>

        <p>So I asked, "aʃaˈsel fu fol tar matʃiˈqar?" (where did the greenhouse go).</p>

        <p class="note">He understood me, but I'm pretty sure this isn't how you'd say something went missing. There are a few other ways, including an nominalizer "-selpaʃ" that replaces the patient nominalizer when something goes missing or is destroyed. At the very least I should have asked what happened <em>to</em> the greenhouse, not where it went.</p>

        <p>Zhoniker responded: "ˈtaraʃ tar anoritʃiper. tʃiˈproŋ kaˈpel tar krifiʃuler pamaˈtar" (it was destroyed by the Oriti. The people of Matar rebuilt it).</p>

        <p>"tʃiˈʒaŋa qap fimol?" (why doesn't it exist?)</p>

        <p class="note">Note: this may be better translated as "why doesn't it inhabit something?" because the patient of the transitive verb ʒaŋa (to exist) is the place it exists in.</p>

        <p>"tʃiˈproŋ araˈʃel. tar anoritʃiper. ʃoˈpoŋki fufu tʃiˈproŋ kaˈpel anʃi fu matʃiqar. ʃoˈsempa fufu tʃiˈproŋ anʒa araˈʃel" (it was re-destroyed. By the Oriti. If we rebuilt it, they would destroy it again).</p>
        
        <h3>Food allergy</h3>

        <p>I brought food to share with Zhoniker (enough food for the two days), but he had an allergic reaction to the food. It was a minor one, but he was very clearly uncomfortable and having slight trouble breathing. His face went red too. Luckily I had my meds with me, which included generic non drowsy antihistamine (same compound as zyrtec), so I gave him one and within a half hour all his symptoms were gone. But I have no idea what caused the allergic reaction.</p>

        <p>So it seems like it's the kind of minor allergy that can be fixed with zyrtec? But I would still like to figure out what triggered it. The food I brought had rice, olive oil, chicken, peas, and a spice blend. And some root vegetables.</p>

        <h3>First Village: Writing System</h3>

        <p>The first village we visited was called Mapar. There were beautiful trees growing everywhere, but the first thing that caught my eye was the writing. I had a double take; was that an alef and a reysh I saw? They looked similar enough, but the symbol before them (RTL) wasn't something I recognized. I've created a graphic of what the sign looked like using inkscape:</p>

        <img src="/images/written-qwamaq/mapar.png" alt="A right to left writing system consisting of a spiral glyph resembling a tree followed by a styled aleph and reysh">

        <p>The thickness of the lines was consistent all the way through, which made it really easy to recreate in inkscape.</p>

        <p>It was weird because some of the glyphs I didn't recognize. I pointed to the signs and told Zhoniker "fol kaˈpoʃ?" (what is that? literally "what thing")</p>

        <p>"ʃopiˌkataˈfoʃ fu kaˈpoʃ" (It's writing).</p>

        <p class="note">Note: I have come to learn that /kataf/ is a root meaning "to write." Which sounds a lot like the hebrew word for writing. Which is. Weird. Why does it seem like this language has Hebrew influence? Were there people from my world here before me and Dora? I mean, there must have been if the book was made. Also note /i-kataf-oʃ/ is a stative verb form of the word for "that which is written" (i.e. writing). /i-/ is a productive prefix that turns a noun into a stative verb.</p>

        <p>I pointed at the reysh and pronounced [ɾa]. Zhoniker's eyes lit up and he said "tʃikeʃi qap par fufu tʃiˈkor mekeˈnel epi tar!" (I didn't know you could read it!).</p>

        <p class="note">Note: he used ejectives for this statement to show enthusiasm, I just didn't feel like transcribing them.</p>

        <p>I think. I think this is somehow the hebrew script, but with logograms. There was a new logogram here for "ma." This is pretty cool. I will be documenting any writing I see. I've kind of always wanted there to be a logography version of yiddish; maybe I will adapt this for Yiddish lol!</p>

        <p>I asked Zhoniker to write matar, and he wrote this:</p>

        <img src="/images/written-qwamaq/matar.png" alt="A right to left writing system consisting of mem aleph tav, then an aleph reysh ligature">

        <p>No logogram here, but what was really interesting to me is that he connected the aleph and the reysh at the end. I asked Zhoniker to write his name, and he wrote this: </p>

        <img src="/images/written-qwamaq/zhoniker.png" alt="A right to left writing system consisting of a glyph resembling legs facing the left, but one of them is a spiral, followed by an ayin reysh ligature">

        <p>Once again, in his handwriting, he combined the reysh with the letter before it (which in this case was ayin). And I'm assuming the first bit is the logograph for ʒonik, which means "to walk." I'm going to have to get him to show me all of the logograms he knows. I had no idea he could write!</p>

        <p>Interestingly, they use ayin for e, just like Yiddish! I wonder how they write o. I don't see a world in which vav isn't u and yod isn't i. But I digress.</p>

        <p>I showed Zhoniker the hebrew textbook and flipped through it. I said, "ʃopiˌpiɴqliʃiˈfaq epi fu qamifaq paˈpaka." (This is English, my language; lit "the thing that an English person uses is it and is my language"). But there was also hebrew on every page, and he seemed to recognize most of the letters.</p>

        <p>He said, "ˌʃopiˌqwamaqiˈfaq qap epi" (this isn't Qwamaq). I laughed and said "qap" (no).</p>

        <h3>Stopping and Going to Sleep</h3>

        <p>I learned a new phatic phrase today! The thing you say to say "goodnight, lipamanka" is "be in good fabric, lipamanka" (miˈqami fu toraper, soˈʒaŋa fu ʃaŋŋaˌpalaˈmoʃ). So I will say this to you all! miˈqami an, soˈʒaŋa fu ʃaŋŋapalamoʃ.</p>

        <p>Zhoniker and I are sleeping outside under the stars. Apparently it's common for the Qwamaq to sleep outside while travelling. They don't bring tents with them on journeys, they only draw a circle around themselves. Or at least this is what Zhoniker did. He also sang a song:</p>

        <p>"miˈqamiˈqami fu nataˈler paˌnataliˈqar. miˈʃum an. esiˌʃiʃraˈŋa fu nataliˈqar paˈpampaka. esʃuŋˈŋa ampar fufu tʃiˈkaʃu ano. ʃoˈkaʃu an ampar" (o spirits of the ground, protect us and live (thread yourselves) in our ground. protect us while we sleep. Put us to sleep.)</p>

        <p>I wonder if people who aren't songwalkers bring tents with them. I guess I can ask Zhoniker in the morning. Alright, signing off. Zhoniker is waiting for me on the soft and cool moss.</p>

        <p>There's something about the moss, the air, the stars, Zhoniker sleeping beside me, feeling protected by the spirits. I'm writing this having woken up with the sun for the first time in a while. Zhoniker is still asleep. I imagined it'd be the other way around. He's resting his head on my chest. I'm typing on my phone and updating my website via the github app lol. HTML is kind of funky to use on a phone but I'm making do.</p>

        <p>I'm noticing all the flora and fauna. All around us there's dew on the moss, but within our little circle, the moss is as dry as it was when we went to sleep (which is to say, moist, but not dewy). I see a line of ants avoiding our circle and going around it, carrying leaves on their backs. I can hear birds singing to each other. They sound just like they did when I visited mesoamerica. But I was very young back then, and the glass through which I see the past is stained by the trauma of loss.</p>

        <p>And so my day begins. Calm, still, warmed by sun and body, cooled by moss and air. Warmed by anxiety and anticipation, cooled by shade and breezes. G-d I hate the mornings. I always felt so alone when I would wake up early.</p>

        <p>I will update again later today. We should reach Konoprar tonight or tomorrow morning. I think. I just wanted to get my thoughts down. Zhoniker is smiling. I wonder what he's dreaming about.</p>

        <summary id="oct-19-2">Oct 19 7:00 PM</summary>
        <p>Several things happened today, just like yesterday! I already told you what waking up was like. I was really bored, but when Zhoniker woke up, we cradled one another for a short while before beginning our trek up a hill well forested and thorned, but fragrant and rosy. When we reached the top, Zhoniker pointed to a town two greater hill before us, each hill with a great arch built upon it.</p>

        <p>I can't help but think that I'm something new today.</p>

        <p>We spent the rest of the day approaching the bottom of the Konoprar hill. We didn't talk. I wasn't feeling talkative, and he didn't seem bothered by the silence.</p>

        <p>At one point he stopped walking and said, "tʃiˈʒaŋa fu konoprar tar keraŋer paˈpaka," he said. "ʃoˈmaŋi fufu aʃaˈkaŋil qamiˈqar epi par. ʃoˈsempa fufu ˈtasoke proɴˈqar qamiˈpel epi par" (My parent lives in Konoprar. I don't speak to him, but maybe I can come to re-speak with him).</p>

        <p>I lifted my arms as if to offer a hug, but he didn't notice, so I just hugged him. He hugged me back for a short while and then we started walking again.</p>

        <h3>Bramble patch</h3>

        <p>We passed by some berries that resembled raspberries, save for the fruits were composed of much more pink segments. They remind me of cloudberries a bit but they're very very large.</p>

        <p>"ʃopiˌpuluŋˈkwam ʃopiˌtumpaˈper ampi" (they're join-together edible plants and fruits).</p>

        <p class="note">Note: the "uluŋ" here is the same as the "ulum" I used when talking about rocks with Uqumer a couple of days ago. I've heard the /-kwam/ agentive nominalizer a few times before. It seems to be mostly used for edible plants, but not for ALL edible plants.</p>

        <p>We spent about five minutes picking berries and eating them. They were kind of bland, honestly. They tasted like under ripe raspberries with the texture of ripe raspberries.</p>

        <p>I said, "ʃoˈpoŋki fufu emˌmiʃiˈŋa fu ʒaɴˈqar paˈpaka, ʃoˈmiŋku fufu aʃaˈsel wokaˈpel par iʃ fufu ... fufu tumpaˈper. uniˌtumpaˈper fu epi" while pointing to the bush. (When you come to my place I'll bring you to a fruit... this is like the fruit).</p>

        <p class="note">Note: this was my attempt at saying "I'll take you to a fruit like this one" but it came off a little weird I think. He didn't correct me though. Having to circumlocute around there being no demonstrative except for a weird infix nobody uses is tricky!</p>

        <p>He responded with "puriˈpuri" (please).</p>

        <h3>More info on songwalking</h3>

        <p>While we walked I asked Zhoniker some questions I had about songwalking. My first question was "ʃaˈkʼa ta? iˌkaʃiˈper un" (do you work a lot? you're a petitioner).</p>

        <p>Apparently, even though some people are particularly skilled at songwalking, such as Zhoniker, and do it professionally, everyone knows how to songwalk and does it from time to time. Most villages have at least one songwalker (Matar just has Zhoniker at the moment), but some don't, and they do just fine because everyone does their part. </p>

        <p>Songwalkers are usually tasked with setting up events and leading group petitions, which tend to be much more powerful than what one person can do. If a whole village comes together and asks for rain, the spirits in the sky are more likely to take notice, especially the ones that live in the water, and if everyone draws a circle, the spirits will all come down to live in the circles. That's the logic, at least.</p>

        <p>It's said that songwalking doesn't work outside of Qwamaqqar, but Zhoniker has never heard of anyone testing that out. The mountains, even though not populated by the Qwamaq, are still considered part of Qwamaqqar, potentially because Qwamaq folk live on the beaches behind the mountains.</p>

        <p>My next question was: "tʃiˈkaʃi fu nataler tar fol fimfim ʃoˈqom un?" (who will petition the spirits while you're gone?) And he responded simply with "Akakiper. esiˈkaʃi oʒa fu qoɴqar. tʃiˈqolim fu Zhoniker" (Akakiper. She used to petition. They used to call her "Zhoniker.") Which is interesting! At least Matar will be safe while we're gone, and I didn't know that Akakiper was a retired songwalker!</p>

        <p>Zhoniker also told me that all plants need songwalking or petitioning to grow on Qwamaq land, especially during the dry season. Every tree has circles carved into it so that spirits can inhabit the tree and help it grow. Even the smaller plants have evolved to grow with circles on them, because the circles allow spirits to live within them.</p>

        <p>It kind of reminds me of indigenous stewardship. Of course the Qwamaq play an important role in their ecosystem. Even though I'm somewhat skeptical that plants wouldn't grow without songwalking, I HAVE seen songwalking work in real time, so I'm vaguely trusting Zhoniker on this one.</p>

        <h3>We see a deer!!!</h3>

        <p>Or maybe it was like a gazelle or something! I'm not an expert on animals. It definitely looked like a deer, and it had no horns. Zhoniker called it "ʒonikipiŋkiˈkor" (strong-running animal? I think?). That's about it for that one; it was just exciting for me!</p>

        <h3>We Passed Some Olsem Folk</h3>

        <p>So first I should talk a little bit about how the Qwamaq people (the Anqwamaqer) look, so I can explain how ODD it was to see a group of Olsem walking together.</p>

        <p>Qwamaq usually wear sarongs (called qaʃuˈfaq), which are large cloths that are wrapped around the whole body under the arms. People of all genders wear these as a base. Some people cover their shoulders with another cloth (called ʃiliŋoʃ, which also means hat or tarp). Zhoniker does this, and so does Akakiper, but Uqumer and the children don't. The Anqwamaqer also tend to have lots of tattoos, but that's not universally true (Zhoniker only has one, on his right arm). The Anqwamaqer also don't wear shoes and have callused feet.</p>

        <p>The Qwamaq tend to dress in a maximum of two colors. Their clothing uses a lot of opposite colors. For example, on this day, Zhoniker wore a purple Sarong with a yellow shoulder covering.</p>

        <p>The Qwamaq I've seen have light olive skin with cool tones. In Matar (and Mapar too!), everyone seemed to have the same skin tone. They also skew tall. Zhoniker is about a head taller than I am (I'm just under 5'7"), and Uqumer and Akakiper are both about my height. They have ever so slightly droopy eyes (kind of like my father and grandfather, actually) and very small noses. They all have smooth shaven heads (no matter the gender) and I've seen Zhoniker shave his.</p>

        <p>So you can imagine my shock when I saw a group of very short people with eyes that curved upward, long black hair, a large variety of skin tones, and extremely colorful clothing. Instead of sarongs, they were all dressed in skirts and what I can best describe as crop tops, with lots of jewelry everywhere. The Qwamaq only wear one ring each. The Olsem did have the same noses as the Qwamaq I've seen, though.</p>

        <p>Zhoniker stopped and talked to them in a language I couldn't recognize at all, and they seemed to get along. I wasn't prepared at all for a new language, so I don't have any information for you, except for I noticed [dʒ] and [ʎ] and a LOT of diphthongs.</p>

        <p>I will ask Zhoniker more about them when I get the chance, but he stopped and talked with them for so long that I took the time to catch up on what has been going on in MY world. I'm glad I can just escape into Qwamaqqar, but I'm not sure Qwamaqqar is free of political issues. So far I've heard NOTHING good about the Oriti.</p>

        <p>When Zhoniker finished speaking with the Olsem, he explained to me who they were. They're an indigenous ethnic group that live in the mountains to the North (I already knew that much), but he told me about their importance to the Qwamaq economy. The fruit that the Qwamaq use to remove tattoos (which is surprisingly REALLY common) only grows wildly in the mountains, and cultivated versions lose all tattoo-removing properties. I asked why these Olsem were in Qwamaq land, and he said "fifi maqomer" (because of a far away tree). So. I am really confused. Uqumer said the same thing about the origin of the oil. Is there some mysterious tree out there, or is this just a weird idiom?</p>

        <p>Anyway, Zhoniker and I are going to go to sleep now. We will be arriving in Konoprar tomorrow morning.</p>

        <p>Finally made it to Konoprar! It's a pretty large city. I think. idk for sure; it has walls, and they go all around it, and I've been able to see the whole thing from afar. It's nestled between two hills, and the front gate is to the east, so on my way I got a chance to see the whole thing. It is probably nowhere near as large as the cities I've been to in the United States. It would be closer to a large town, like perhaps a few times the size of Bemidji or Hyannis or Great Barrington or something.</p>

        <p>Here is what the spelling of "Konoprar" is in the Qwamaq writing system:</p>

        <img src="/images/written-qwamaq/konoprar.png" alt="A right to left writing system consisting of a kaf, then a circle with an upwards facing crecent lying on top, and then an alef reysh ligature.">

        <h3>Entrance</h3>

        <p>Before I could even enter Konoprar, Zhoniker had an exchange with an older Qwamaq person with a fantastic beard. Zhoniker opened: "tako ono oʃi. poˌqolinˈʃi anʒa paka fu ʒoniˈker. esiˈʃiʃra par fu matar. poˌqolinˈʃi oʒa fu toraˈper. esiˈʃiʃra par fu ʒaɴqar paˌtoraˌtoraˈper fu toraˈpam." (Greetings. They call me Zhoniker. My thread is in Matar. This is Toraper, and Toraper is from the place that Dora Lipman is from, known as Torapam.)</p>

        <p class="note">Note that "my thread is in Matar" plays into the "people are needles going through the fabric that is the land" conceputal metaphor. I may expand on this later, but know that here it means "I technically live in Matar right now."</p>

        <p>The older Qwamaq person nodded and said "tapa ˌtoraˌtoraˈper. hm. ʃoˈkor ono fufu aʃaˈmiʃ anʃi fu konoprar." (Dora Lipman, eh? Hm. I allow you to enter into Konoprar.)</p>

        <p>And thus we were permitted to enter the city. Zhoniker told me later, "tʃiˈpuri oʒa fufu ʃoˈpalam qwamaqiˈfaq paˈtampaka." (They were checking to see if our Qwamaq speaking was good.) I think Konoprar is "fortified," unlike Matar, mostly based on the walls, but also based on Zhoniker and his family using the word "aramˈoʃ" to describe it before (which I think literally means "beseigable" which is kind of funny, but it's used to describe fortified settlements, as opposed to non-fortified ones).

        <h3>Smells and sounds!</h3> 

        <p>The first thing I noticed upon entering was the SMELL! Well, there was more than one smell, but they were all amazing! It appeared everyone was cooking, and it seemed to me like everyone was wafting the steam from their pots directly into my face. </p>

        <p>I smelled sweet apple-like smells, shellfish, and a beautifully funky soy sauce-like scent. Lots of cooking vegetables too, stuff that smelled like mild cheeses, and umami glazes. Qwamaq people were outside of their houses kneading dough and pasting fruits. It was about mid-day.

        <h3>Signs!</h3>

        <p>As soon as I managed to quell my whelms from smells and sounds, I started to notice writing EVERYWHERE. Unlike in Mapar, where I only got a chance to see one sign, it seemed like every building was labeled. I recognized NONE of the writing. Here are some more things I noticed:</p>

        <ul> 
        <p><li>All of the writing looked like it was burned into wood</li></p>
        <p><li>The line thickness of the strokes was uniform for each sign, though it differed between signs</li></p>
        <p><li>Each glyph when repeated had slight alterations, suggesting that it wasn't some sort of font</li></p>
        <p><li>Once again, the writing system seems to be composed of characters from the hebrew aleph bet, in addition to logograms</li></p>
        <p><li>In many places, people combined glyphs as Zhoniker had two days ago, but many others didn't do this and wrote them separately</li></p>
        </ul>

        <p>Learning to read Qwamaq properly is going to be a pretty serious undertaking if I feel I need to do it. For the time being though, I have Zhoniker, who can just tell me what stuff says. So I'm not going to worry about it too much. But if I feel like it, I may include written versions of the text from time to time! Maybe some of y'all can help me figure out what's going on.</p>

        <p>HOWEVER. Almost every sign ended with the same symbol. Here are four signs I saw and what Zhoniker told me they said:</p>

        <img src="/images/written-qwamaq/shop-signs.png" alt="A right to left writing system consisting of four  words. In order, they read kashumelezh, tumpamelezh, pukimelezh, and korammelezh. They are composed of hebrew glyphs and logograms.">




        <p class="note">Note the rebus! The tav next to the glyph in tumpameleʒ may distinguish this glyph from another possible meaning. We'll see how invested I am in learning this writing going forward, and if I am, I'll give an update on the other potential meanings of the glyph.</p>

        <h3>Off Limits Buildings</h3>

        <p>One building was mysteriously labeled "qaɴqar," which means "the place that opens into a house," but Zhoniker told me "aʃaˈkor miˈʃel fu qaˈmel" (you can't enter the interior). I asked "fimol" (why) and he said, "ʃiʃraˌpakiˈpel," which means either "rock house" or "old wise house." Probably the second, because the sign did look very old. I asked him why again and he said "fifi maqoˈmer" (because of a far away tree) and I am starting to get the sense that it means "I don't feel like explaining this." Note the triple ligature in the sign for this building though!</p>



        <img src="/images/written-qwamaq/qanqar.png" alt="A right to left writing system consisting of a glyph resembling a window with curtains followed by a three glyph ligature of quf, alef, and reysh.">

        <p>I don't know why the building would be off limits, but I don't wanna test this out until I need to. Zhoniker is usually lax about rules, but he seemed to not want to enter at all.</p>

        <h3>Zhoniker's Father</h3>

        <p>Zhoniker told me that he was raised by his mother, Uqumer, and his grandmother, Akakiper. Apparently, they use the same word (fosoˈler, which also means "farmer") for anyone who takes care of you, and any family member who is related to you but wasn't involved in caring for you is called a "keraŋer." Anyone else isn't considered part of your family. It's kind of like the term "bio-parent," without the added connotation that someone is estranged.</p>

        <p>We would be staying with Zhoniker's father, who lived with a younger woman named "rameter." Their home was nestled against the southern wall of Konoprar and between two trees that bore fruit. The fruit looked like a tomato, oblong and odd, but when I went to feel one, it was firm like an apple. Zhoniker said "tumpanuˈser," which I think means "breathing fruit," but is probably just what the fruit is called.</p>

        <p>The trees looked like they were struggling, even though trees all over Konoprar looked like they were doing well. The fruit was small and seemed underripe (though I don't know what ripeness is supposed to look like for those fruits).</p>

        <p>The house had two stories and was made of stones that for the most part fit together snugly like the tiling of Uqumer's home, but several stones seemed to be loose. They still had circles drawn on them, though. I pointed at them and looked inquisitorally at Zhoniker, who said "tʃiˈkor kaʃiˈpam par fufu ʃoˈpulum fu akiper" (I can petition the stones to come together). But aren't there plenty of songwalkers here?</p>

        <p>Zhoniker told me to wait outside, and he went inside. After a few minutes, he came outside looking a little upset but said, "tʃiˈkor oʒi fufu aʃaˈʃiʃra anʃi qaˈmel" (He said we could move in).</p>

        <p>I asked Zhoniker, "ta ʃoˈpalam un?" (are you good?). And he responded, while shaking slightly, with "esiˈlif ono tar moɱfaq." Which, I think, means "teeth live inside me."</p>

        <p class="note">Which is confusing, but it's probably an idiom. It is oddly common that Qwamaq speakers use a wealth of idioms to talk about their feelings. I've also heard "ʃoˈpalap ʃwikiˈŋer mafˌesiˈlif ono" for "I'm happy" (literally "the bird within me is dancing").</p>

        <p>We brought the doorframe into the dwelling. We set it up in the room Zhoniker would be living in moving forward as I looked for information on Dora. I opened a portal back home and fell to the ground at Scott's stoop. I made it to Konoprar. Now all I have to do today is homework... damn. Whatever.</p> 

        <p>Before I left, I told Zhoniker that if he ever wanted to return to Matar, or otherwise needed me for something, he could put some interesting keepsake through the cheesecloth gateway and I would see it. I'm still planning on returning soon, but I'm not sure how much time I'll need to recuperate! But if Zhoniker needs to return to Matar without having to travel over the course of several days, he would need to be able to travel through a gateway to Scott's house, walk a few blocks west, and then open another gateway from the door in my room. And I would need to guide him through that.</p>

        <p>He told me that it would be easy for him to find work in Konoprar as a songwalker. So I'm not worried. I just… feel like I uprooted his life, and I have no idea how to show him how thankful I am that he wanted to guide me.</p>

            <p>I took a bit of a day off yesterday. Walking for miles is exhausting. But it was worth it!</p>

            <p>I finally returned to Qwamaqqar. Today, I spent time looking around Konoprar with Zhoniker, learning about how the city functions, but also keeping an eye out for clues about Dora.</p>

            <h3>Local Architecture</h3>

            <p>The buildings here, unlike the buildings in Matar, are built of stone. But most buildings are very well taken care of by those who live in them, and songwalkers often walk the streets singing so that the stones can fit together snugly.</p>

            <p>There are some very beautiful buildings here. The most stunning buildings are the ones built with many different types of stone, just like the floor in Uqumer's dwelling, but much more impressive.</p>

            <p>There are plants growing along every wall. Even though each stone fits together with every other, the surface is still rough enough for plants to cling and climb. There are vines that remind me of ivy, save for they smell fragrant, as if roses had rooty carroty notes. The smells in Konoprar are still fantastic.</p>

            <p>There are so many cool buildings here, and they are ALL labeled. One building has a very long label, pictured below. I saw it while Zhoniker was distracted talking to someone, so I haven't gotten a chance to ask him what it said yet, but I may tomorrow if I remember. I have vectorized it anyway because I think the writing system is really pretty.</p>

            <!--The sign leads into the catacombs, and reads "the tunnels lead deep into the mountains. The purest song alone will inspire the spirits to guide you to the good things, to the old things." aʃaˈpor fu sokaŋoˈper tar poriˈpaʃ woŋˈŋapa. tʃiˈklom tar afwikaˈpoʃ mafiʃoˌʒifiˈmoŋa fufu aʃaˈfemi inʃ tar nataˈler fu kaˌpalaˈmoʃ fu kaˌpakiˈpoʃ.-->

            <p>While walking the streets of Konoprar with Zhoniker, we heard several intriguing things about the city. Let me know which I should explore further. I can't explore them all in the same day!</p>

            <h3>Wisdom Holders</h3>

            <p>Zhoniker apparently already knew about this one. In the center of the city is a very large building where what amounts to a polycule of elderly Qwamaq (called by the title "Anakiper," which is the word "akiper" with the archaic plural prefix /an-/) with an enormous amount of tattoos spend their time sharing wisdom with members of the city. Like Akakiper, these people get called upon for neologisms and the like. There are over a dozen of them, many of whom are very old. This may be a good lead.</p>

            <p>We walked by the building they lived in, but Zhoniker was too nervous to go in this time. He told me "unˈpikiŋ ampi par fim ŋiˌdiʒiˈfaq" (I have fewer tattoos than they do). I responded with "tʃiˈpikiŋ, ʃoˈpiŋa fufu ʃoˈkor ampi tatar aʃaˈsel iʃ fu qaˈmel papaˌnakiˈper" (sure, but fortunately they will let you inside).</p> 

            <p>"ʃoˈsempa fufu pompoˌŋaʃikaˈper," he said (maybe a different day). I decided to stop pressing him on it for now. Though, if needed, I do think I could talk him into it. Tattoos are far less permanent here, so I (not the WORST visual artist out there) could theoretically tattoo him also, which would definitely make him feel more comfortable.</p> 

            <h3>Fortune Teller's Hut</h3>

            <p>A word I've heard a few times around town is "keˌʃiʃipeˈler." If I'm understanding it correctly, it is, phonemically, /keʃi-ʃipel-er/. keʃi means "know" (information about), and ʃipel is a clipping of "ʃiʃrapel" which means "a future dwelling" but is also used as a noun to mean "the future" I think? or "fate." Like the dative object of threading yourself through a hole is your fate. But in any case, that would mean that "keˌʃiʃipeˈler" means "fortune teller."</p>

            <p>Maybe I can find out where they live! I would love to engage with this culture's divination, though of course I don't know that much about it, so I can't make any assumptions.</p>

            <h3>The Catacombs</h3>

            <p>Apparently there are tunnels somewhere under the city. I'm not quite sure what's in them. Zhoniker says "esiˈlif tar nataˈler fu poriˈpaʃ" (there are spirits in the tunnels), which like duh. Obviously. There are spirits everywhere. I bet there are circles drawn all over the place too.</p> 

            <p>Apparently, songwalkers have to walk through the tunnels regularly and sing very specific ancient songs as old as the town itself 

            <p class="note">"tʃiˈkaŋil afaˈqar tar kaʃiˈper fu ʃwikiˈŋoʃ mafeˈsafa fu qʼoɴqʼar. uŋˈkwami fu konoˈprar tar ʃiŋoʃ" is what Zhoniker said, which means "petitioners periodically sing songs that were sung very long ago. The songs lived like Konoprar." I think the word "kwami" is used as a copula there? so it's more like comparing the "long-ago-ness" of the songs to the "long-ago-ness" of Konoprar. I could be wrong about this though. idk. Note the ejectives in qʼoɴqʼar for emphasis. I think analyzing this as morphemic pulmonicity (pulmonicness?) is pretty silly, which is why I will be sticking with my "child-speak code switching" analysis.</p>

            <p>Zhoniker told me that he didn't know that much about the tunnels, besides the songs that Akakiper taught him when he learned to become a songwalker. Apparently there are three. The first one uses a lot of wordplay around the word for "tunnel" which can also mean veins, arteries, nerves, or intestines, personifying Konoprar as a person and the songwalkers as spirits moving through the body of Konoprar purging dark spirits.</p>

            <p>The second is a little more literal, saying that Konoprar's tunnels run deep and old and are filled with love and are being taken care of.</p>

            <p>But the last one. Is. REALLY intriguing. It has the phrase "esiˈkwami fu poriˈpaʃ tar kaˌpalaˈmoʃ" (in the tunnels is a good thing), and then the same line repeated, with kaˌpalaˈmoʃ replaced with kaˌpakiˈpoʃ (old thing). And Zhoniker explained that "a good thing, an old thing" is a phrase for treasure. Which is really interesting! When I asked him how old Konoprar was, he said he didn't know.</p>

            <h3>The House of Relics</h3>

            <p>In New York, where I grew up, there were plenty of museums everywhere. But in Konoprar, there is only one: the house of relics. (kiŋoˈmoʃ pakaˌpakiˈpoʃ, literally "building of old things"). See below for the signage.



            <img src="/images/written-qwamaq/kingomosh_pakapakiposh.png" alt="A right to left writing system consisting of a half circle with an arc on the right side, then a reysh shin ligature. On the second line, there is a pey aleph ligature, followed by a kaf, followed by a small circle, followed by another kaf, followed by a spear logogram, followed by a reysh shin ligature." style="width: 70%">
            <br>

            <p class="note">I THINK that reysh is being used for /o/. None of the epenthetic [p]s are being written, which leads me to believe that the writing system is largely phonemic, not phonetic. I'm assuming that the spear logogram there is used for a lot of words, but with the kaf, it means "aki," which is the same "aki" in "akiper" and "Akakiper." It is REALLY odd being able to read about half of their writing system off the bat.</p>

            <p>Apparently they have some really old things in the House or Relics (I'm calling it that because I think it sounds WAY cooler than "old-things building"). They have books written in a very old script. If I wanted to learn more about the origins of Qwamaq writing, I should probably seek it there.</p>

            <p>They also have objects that belonged to mythical songwalkers. Zhoniker was telling me one story of a songwalker who sang so sweetly she could turn into a bird and fly, and that her flute (or some sort of wind instrument; he held his hands as if he was playing a clarinet or a fipple flute) was within. That's stuff that I'm kind of interested in. This place is cool as fuck!</p> 

            <p>Lowkey I might make a font for Qwamaq. That would be really fun and doable.</p>

            <summary id="thread-and-needles">Tangent: Thread, Needles, Possession, and Death</summary>

            <p>I would like to take a moment to expand on the wonderful conceptual metaphor the Qwamaq employ. This shows up in a lot of idiomatic expressions and in the lexicon of Qwamaq. In Qwamaq, people are needles, the places they live are the holes they're passing through, and their thread leads back to everywhere they've ever lived. Qwamaqqar itself is an enormous cloth. Sometimes people call Qwamaqqar "great cloth" (ˌʃaŋŋapiŋˈkoʃ, ʃaŋŋa being "to weave" and piŋk being "brave" or "strong" or "big").</p>

            <p>Zhoniker told me that when someone dies, unless it was suddenly or unexpectedly, their soul is bound to one of their body's bones and their spirit (nataˈler paˈmaʃa) is sealed in a circle on the bone. Before each person dies, they designate someone to take their thread. Many Qwamaq carry bones of many ancestors with them when they travel. Zhoniker didn't do this because Akakiper still has all of the bones.</p>

            <p>In a lot of languages in our world, the alienability of possession is grammaticalized. For example, im Menominee, you can't say "hand" without inflecting the word for <em>whose</em> hand it is. Is it his/her hand? is it my hand or your hand? You cannot say the word "hand" on its own in Menominee.</p>

            <p>While less grammaticalized, Qwamaq still takes the concept a bit further. The act of possession begins when an object is created. Whoever the object was created for becomes the owner, and this rarely changes. In order to change ownership of an item, a ritual process is required. Apparently there are people in some of the larger cities (like Konoprar, actually) whose job it is to appraise the owner of these items using divination. Zhoniker says they commune with the spirits of the object.</p>

            <p>The Qwamaq believe that spirits keep track of this ownership for us, but it's still a tall ask to petition them for this information, so it's considered respectful to remember all of this information about each object.</p> 

            <p>Even though this ownership isn't necessarily grammaticalized, in the case of bones, it appears to be completely grammatically required to specify who "owns" them. These bones maintain the same ownership forever. Once someone dies, the ownership of their bones cannot be changed. The word for bone (ratʃiˌʃiʃraˈper, often shortened to just ratʃiˈper, lit. "that which remains of a person" or just "that which remains") is always followed by a word with the adjectival prefix /pa-/. If people don't know who's bones they are, they will say "patapˈpaʃ" (pa-faf-paʃ, lit. "of the thing that was killed").</p> 

            <p>The names of the people these bones belong to are often very long, because once someone dies, people who knew them gather and decide what their name should be forever. It's often five words long, including relative clauses describing important things they did or were. It's a really sweet ceremony.</p>

            <p>While everyone's input is valued at these gatherings, the person with the final say is the one previously designated to be given the "thread" of the dying person. The more bones someone carries with them, the stronger their thread is. It's said that a thread never dies with a person, but if discarded, the thread is invisible (mekenuˈmuŋi, lit. "thing that cannot be seen"), and therefore the spirit will be lost and undistinguished from the rest of the spirits.</p>

            <p>Zhoniker says that it's everyone's fate to one day become invisible, and that it isn't a negative thing to become one with the spirits of the land. He made sure to make it clear to me that this was a him-only thing, but he believes that new people's spirits come from the sea of spirits around us at all times, and that it's a reincarnation cycle. Though I believe that many others share the general sentiment that it isn't a bad thing to become invisible.</p> 

            <p class="note">Zhoniker said "ʃopaʃiʃrafaq papikrifeˌŋer fufu ʃoˈpasoke meqenumuɴiqar epi," which I translate as "the hand of fate of every person is that they will become unseeable."</p>

            <p>Right now, Zhoniker is the one that Akakiper has chosen to inherit all of the threads she carries, including her own. It's common to offer this to a songwalker in a family, or some other type of magical practitioner, because these bones hold great power within them. Zhoniker stopped himself before elaborating, though. I didn't press him on it because he would have probably responded with "a far away tree" and left me fuming.</p>

            <p>Apparently, there are other relics with specific spirits sealed in them, and there are also other specific spirits with their own names and worshippers, but I don't have time for all that right now lol.</p>

            <p>Now that Zhoniker has moved to Konoprar, he is, metaphorically, a thread going through the fabric of Qwamaqqar in Konoprar, even if he returns home. The more people move, the longer their thread is, which may be a good thing? I'm not really sure. But it might be why he was so enthusiastic about helping me make it to Konoprar.</p>

            <p>This section was kind of rambly so if you have any questions, please let me know! I will consider adding updates to this section with more info so that information on this conceptual metaphor and the associated cultural practices are all in one place, but I will also do my best to answer questions over discord if possible.</p>
