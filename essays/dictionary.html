    <h2 id="description">What is this dictionary?</h2>
        <p>Most dictionaries for toki pona only have a list of some english concepts that fit into a word's semantic space. This can be very useful at a glance, but it doesn't teach the core of the semantic space. There were no dictionaries built around descriptions of a word, using sentences, using paragraphs. So I decided to make one!</p>

        <p>This project describes the semantic spaces in depth of all toki pona words in pu, save for words without semantic spaces (a, en, li, e, anu, o, la, and pi) and including tonsi. Once complete, I may add a section for nonpu words that are common enough to warrant it, such as monsuta and leko.</p>

        <p>By the nature of toki pona, the semantic spaces of words will be known best through conversation, so I encourage everyone reading this to do two things: <strong>talk about these semantic spaces with people,</strong> and <strong>let me know if there are any discrepancies.</strong> Let me know over discord at lipamanka. I would like to know if my dictionary has entries that don't feel right to other toki pona speakers.</p>

        <p><strong>You can use any toki pona word to refer to anything.</strong> But be warned. With this great power comes the ability to shape the world around you. If you use ilo for your friend, you're framing them as something to be used. If you use nasa to describe an idea, you are saying that that idea is silly. All of the semantic spaces I've listed below should serve as a list of traits. Think of them not as a list of objects you can use the words for, but rather a list of traits with which you can frame any object. The more similar an object is to the description I've provided, the better a fit it is! The less similar, the more of a metaphor you're evoking. But that's just the nature of toki pona. The semantic spaces are so large that you'll get used to using metaphor like never before.</p>

        <p>More specific questions:</p>

        <p><strong>What is a semantic space?</strong> A semantic space, put simply, is the range of all possible meanings of a word. This dictionary serves to describe these semantic spaces and name aspects that concepts within the same semantic space all have in common.</p>

        <p><strong>What is an "object" in these definitions?</strong> I use the english word "object" very losely here, almost as losely as toki pona words. an object is, for these definitions, anything. it can be physical, it can be metaphysical, it can be some sort of nominalized action or quality. it can be a person. it can be an idea. so to be clear: this use of "object" is not aiming to dehumanize people.</p>

        <p><strong>Why don't you have XYZ word?</strong> This is a (entirely) descriptive and (mostly) qualitative dictionary. All of the words included here have been used a great deal for years. The more people encourage me to add a new word, the more likely I am to do so! However, know that if the word is not used sufficiently, I cannot be descriptive. Any entry for an obscure word proposal cannot be descriptive. Because like. What usage are you even describing. It MUST be speculative, because these words do not see enough usage to describe a semantic space. I do try to take this case by case though.</p>

    <!--    <p><strong>IN ADDITION, this page contains a functional space dictionary.</strong> A functional space is like a semantic space, but instead of describing meaning, it describes purely functional (i.e. grammatical, non-semantic) roles. In this section I will include all the particles as well as further details on prepositions, preverbs, and nanpa.</p>-->

        <p>So what are you waiting for? Go enjoy the dictionary!!</p>

            <summary id="akesi">akesi</summary>
            <p>akesi are creatures. they tend to be cold to the touch. When they move quickly, they go back and forth on sprawling legs or slither or squirm back and forth across the ground if they lack legs. They're close to the ground. They usually lay eggs. The contents of this semantic space is based off of a pilot study I conducted in 2023 with sample size 98 about the lexical semantics of akesi.</p>

            <summary id="ala">ala</summary>
            <p>the semantic space of ala contains nothing. But don't be fooled, it isn't void of information. "ala li lukin e kili" can be "nobody's looking at the fruit." "jan li moku e ala" can mean "the person ate nothing." as a modifier, it actually reverses the semantic space of whatever words come before it, which no other content word does. "soweli li alasa ala e kili" can mean "the monkey doesn't forage for fruit." An ijo ala is never a type of ijo. as a verb, ala can mean "erase" or "delete."</p>
    <!--jan Takon: Maybe include something about ala referring to nothingness or outer-space?
                mi lon taso lon ma supa suli. mi lukin e poki la kasi en jan en ijo li lon ala. ala pi pilin ike li suli.

            <summary id="alasa">alasa</summary>
            <p>alasa refers to hunting and foraging. Searching for a lost object is alasa. Searching for something on a web browser is alasa. Throwing a spear into the side of a bison could be alasa because it is part of hunting, as can the act of picking berries, but the core of alasa is the trying to find. Recently (as in during the past half a decade), usage of alasa to refer to attempting or trying has become very common. So trying to knit could be a type of alasa. Trying to sprint could be a type of alasa. Trying to look larger than you actually are to scare off a predator could be alasa.</p>

            <summary id="ale">ale</summary>
            <p>ale is everything. this can be either everything ever or a smaller subset of everything. If you modify ale with another word, it is limited to objects that have that word's quality, such as "ale loje" for "all things red," "ale lipu" for "all things related to books," or "ale pali" for "all things related to working." this is often similar to the reverse, but not exactly the same. for example, "loje ale" is all reds, not all <em>things</em> red, "lipu ale" is all books, and would not talk about a printing press or reading glasses, and "pali ale" would be something like all jobs or activities, and wouldn't talk about a hammer or a cheesecloth.</p>
            <p>Another usage of "ale" I've noticed myself and many others using is the idea of "completeness" or something being all-encompasing. Like if I know everything about rocks, I could say "mi sona ale e kiwen" just as easily as I might say "mi sona e ale kiwen." It's almost used as a superlative sometimes, like "pona ale" for "best" in the sense that it is "completely good." Keep in mind that the English word "complete" has two senses, the other which is much closer to <a href="#pini">pini</a> than ale. Make sure to translate the idea, not the word!</p>

            <summary id="anpa">anpa</summary>
            <p>anpa refers to the space (or sometimes object) below something. For example, "anpa supa" is the space under a table. "anpa kasi" is the space under a plant. anpa can also refer to qualities of defeat and shame, such as beating someone in a game of chess. You can describe the loser as anpa, and you can use anpa as a verb to mean "beat." anpa can also talk about social stratification and hierarchy. A lower class person can be a jan anpa.</p>

            <summary id="ante">ante</summary>
            <p>ante describes a different thing. there are loads of things in the world, and every thing has similarities and differences to other things. In a specific context, if one wishes to frame the differences between objects, ante is incredibly useful. It can refer to the different object itself, qualities of difference, or the concept of change itself. It can also be used as a verb to mean "alter" or "change."</p>

        <details open>
            <summary id="awen">awen</summary>
            <p>awen resists change. awen is the essence of inertia boiled down into one word. if an object is doing something and continues doing that thing, that continuation is awen. if an object is doing <em>nothing,</em> and continues doing nothing, that continuation is also awen. awen is a preverb and changes the meaning from "does the thing" to "continues to do the thing," or "still does the thing."</p>
            <p>awen is also used by many speakers to mean "maintain." This is very close to the idea of protection, so you'll see awen used for that as well in many situations as a transitive verb, but some ideas of "protection" are better described with "<a href="#selo">selo</a>."</p>

            <summary id="esun">esun</summary>
            <p>esun is a type of swap or exchange. Usually it's used to mean "buy," "sell," or "trade." The use of a currency isn't required for something to be esun. Trading baseball cards is esun. esun doesn't imply that both parties lose something. Exchanging knowledge is esun, even though neither party loses knowledge. Some interesting extensions of esun I've seen include using esun for breathing, where one trades the air inside them with the outside world. Seeing esun as a swap more than as a type of buying has had it being used far more often these days in my experience.</p>

            <summary id="ijo">ijo</summary>
            <p>Everything is within the semantic space of ijo. If a thing is a thing, it is an ijo. This could be anything or something. This could be a physical object, an idea, an action, a place, a sentient being, or any other thing. You are in the semantic space of ijo.</p>
            <p>Some people refuse to use ijo for sentient things. They claim it has inanimate connotations. I don't see why this would happen unless toki pona speakers assumed it was the same as english "thing" or portuguese "coisa" etc. In reality, toki pona words don't have the history of dehumanization that words like "thing" in english have. In toki pona, humans are as ijo as a dog or a book or a galaxy.</p>

            <summary id="ike">ike</summary>
            <p>ike is any negative quality. Anything can be ike. ike is a judgement call. what one person considers ike can be pona to another. For example, the complexity of computer coding is not a good thing for me, so I'd call it ike. But for a lot of my friends, that same complexity is pona! the simple melody of "mary had a little lamb" is boring to many people on its own, so they might call it ike. But a baby might enjoy it a lot, so despite being potentially overly simple for adults, it's just right for that baby, i.e. pona. Thought of course some babies may like twelve tone rows and some adults may like what others would consider "children songs." It's all relative and case by case. If something isn't bad, you can't use ike to describe it without framing it as such. ike can mean complex and simple just as easily as pona can.</p>

            <summary id="ilo">ilo</summary>
            <p>The semantic space of ilo contains things that are used towards a goal. It’s easy to say that everything can be used. Likewise if something is being used or can commonly be used, it is easy to call it an ilo. If I am using a hammer to hammer a nail into the wall, that is an ilo. If i am using a psychological method to calm myself down when i’m stressed, that can be an ilo as well. Without much context, ilo can refer to things that are commonly used as tools. With the context of it being used for something, though, anything can be an ilo.</p>

            <summary id="insa">insa</summary>
            <p>insa talks about things inside of things. Commonly, this is used to describe a location. The location inside of a car is insa. It can also be used to describe objects that are inside of things. Someone's organs are insa. insa doesn't need to be contained completely, it can just mean "in between." A book in the middle of a bookshelf is insa. The space between two city buildings is insa. It can be used more abstractly too. When compared to a head, a mind is insa. In the context of good and bad, insa can be neutral. When compared to hot and cold, insa can be lukewarm. If anything is being framed as inside of  something else, it falls under the semantic space of insa.</p>

            <summary id="jaki">jaki</summary>
            <p>jaki talks about unpleasant sensory experiences. This can be any of the senses, internal or external. This could be bad smells, repulsive flavors, gross images, ear-shattering noises, and horrible textures. But it could also be internal sensory experiences such as nausea. jaki can be used to refer to other things that aren't usually sensory, and it should be. But be careful, because using jaki will frame something through a sensory lens. If someone is acting bad, such as bullying or harassing someone else, you can describe their actions as jaki, but doing so makes their actions framed as unpleasant in a sensory way.</p>
            <p>Some people reject the idea that jaki is inherently unpleasant. For example, here is a quote from jan Ke Tami (licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 with permission from jan Ke Tami)</p>
            <p>jan Ke Tami: I keep thinking about the "jaki pona" zine that finds beauty in things that for sure are in some way unpleasant
            <br>
            jaki has enough space for things it describes to be unpleasant in one way... and also pleasant in a different way</p>

            <summary id="jan">jan</summary>
            <p>usage of jan differs a lot between groups of speakers, but many speakers use it broadly to refer to any sentient creature. But this can break down when you consider what sentience is and where we draw lines between ourselves and nature. This also gets complicated when we take into account nonhuman identities such as radical reclamation of dehumanization, which is awesome. many toki pona speakers specifically choose to not be a type of jan, so jan broadly cannot be applicable to all speakers of language. It's still used frequently to refer to a group of people, some of whom may not be humans, and especially "somebody," i.e. a hypothetical unspecified agent. If someone is not a jan, it's often rude to call them one--just stick with whatever word they've chosen for themselves.</p>

            <p>jelo comes from the english word "yellow" and has a very similar meaning. It refers to yellows, oranges, and sometimes yellowish greens. I would use jelo to talk about any shade of cadmium yellow.</p>

            <summary id="jo">jo</summary>
            <p>jo is the act of holding, carrying, possessing, owning, or broadly having. The english word "have" tends to be pretty broad, and jo is no different, but the size of its semantic space differs between speakers. Some speakers will only use jo if an object is in someone's hand or they're holding it. Others will use jo for something as abstract as a word having sounds in it or a language having words in it. for some speakers, if I'm borrowing your book, you don't jo it anymore, I do, even if you own it. For other speakers, in that situation both you and I jo the book at the same time in different ways. When you use jo, you're drawing a metaphor between someone's relationship with an object and a world in which they're holding it in their hands. some people like to stretch this metaphor much farther than others.</p>

            <p>Any creature that swims habitually is a kala. This can include anything from fish to whales to seals. The most important aspect of a kala is its relation to water. kala tend to either live in the water or spend a good portion of their time in it. Some speakers extend this usage a bit and let it refer to anything that is in water, like a human swimmer or a pool noodle. Sometimes, toki ponists will describe the act of showering as kala. This usage is often interpreted as somewhat funny, but it is commonly understood. If it isn't, it's easy to clarify.</p>

            <p>The semantic space of kalama contains all noises and sounds and any act of creating a noise or sound. Any sound from any source can be a kalama. Music is a kalama. A scream is kalama. The sound that a tree makes when it falls in the forest is a kalama. A sound doesn't have to travel through air to be a kalama: whale noises are kalama, and a heartbeat through a stethoscope is kalama. kalama could be an absolute pitch, or multiple. It could be sound designed to sound a certain way, or chaotic noise.</p> 
            <p>From jan Olipija on how kalama's semantic space extends to vibrations with her perspective as a member of the Deaf/hard of hearing community:</p>
            <p>"seeing as sound is vibration and one often causes the other, many [deaf/hard of hearing] can perceive via vibrations what hearing people would perceive as sound. e.g. stamping on the floor, thumpy thumpy dance music or hammering from the downstairs flat renovating their bathroom waking you up at 8am. thus vibrations could be considered a form of kalama, especially to [deaf/hard of hearing] people.</p>
            <p>instead or in addition to kute, this form of kalama would pair with the verb pilin. e.g. 'mi pilin lon noka mi e kalama ilo tan supa anpa.'"</p>

            <p>kama is a strong metaphor in toki pona. To arrive at a location and to arrive at a state of being are the same concept in toki pona. This means that kama can refer to arriving home to eat dinner, arriving at school, or the moment you become an akesi because an evil prescriptivist wizard cursed you for using too many nimisin. This of course describes kama's use as a preverb, in which its meaning is close to "become." This can imply the start, body, or end of this process. It's easy to describe the reverse of whatever process kama preverb is representing by negating the word that follows it, i.e. "kama X ala."</p>

            <p>kasi is any number of types of plants. big plants like trees are kasi, and small plants like weeds are too! anything largely in the category of "plant" is a kasi. There's some controversy about fungi, though. many believe them to be within kasi's semantic space, while others disagree entirely and use a new word, "soko" (which is relatively commonplace). if you want to learn about someone's view on this, just pull up a picture of a mushroom and ask "ni li seme?" and wait for their response. Whether you use kasi to describe mushrooms or not says a lot about how you categorize life. For example, growing up I was told that mushrooms were not plants, so I developed schemes to interpret them differently. Using kasi for a mushroom doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. But that might be completely different for someone else. I often go for "kili" rather than the word "soko." when describing mushrooms.</p>

The throughline here is almost saying that an event is able to occur, but that doesn't mean it necessarily will or won't. These ideas of possibility and ability are two sides of the same coin.</p>

            <p>kili are fruits and vegetables, i.e. any part of a plant that is edible. These could be fresh. An apple is kili. These could be fermented. Kimchi and pickled onions are kili. These could be preserved through canning. Strawberry jam and dried mango are kili. This could even be a sauce with a primary vegetable component: basil pesto is kili, gazpacho is kili, five minced onions are kili. kili can refer to wheat seeds or other grains that haven't been ground up yet, but flour and bread don't fit well into kili's semantic space.</p>
            <p>What if a kili is poisonous? Poisonous berries are not edible, but they can still be kili. This is because kili's semantic space pivots towards things that resemble edible parts of plants, even if you can't actually eat them. By using kili, you evoke the image of eating it. This won't encourage toki pona speakers to eat it right away if they don't recognize it. If I used kili for poison ivy a toki pona speaker would think less of it as a shrub what grows on the ground and more as a type of lettuce for making salad. Of course, they wouldn't assume that it would be a good idea to do so, but the way the poison ivy feels in a conceptual semantic space is different.</p>
            <p>A minority usage of kili proposed first around 2021 online is a child or product. This borrows a cognitive metaphor from a lot of European languages that sees familial relations as trees. While this could work, it is likely to be misunderstood by many speakers unless you build up this <em>before</em> using kili like this. It's also worth considering how this frames children, and wether that isn't as culturally neutral as you may think. In many cultures, children are raised communally and aren't percived as any individual's child. Would kili work in these cases? Maybe not!</p>

It can describe something's material, so a chair made out of a hard material could be kiwen. It is additionally possible to talk about nonphysical things using kiwen, but by using kiwen to describe nonphysical things, their forms are being framed as resisting change. For example, I can describe a recipe as kiwen. With some explaining, this might mean that in order for me to consider it my recipe, it must not change, and if it does change it would no longer be my recipe. There are some other abstract perspectives of kiwen that differ from this, but they're often too abstract and not easily understood. I recommend clarifying what you mean with other words too if you use kiwen abstractly.</p>

            <p>ko is a fantastic word. It has an enormous semantic space and offers some interesting perspective about moisture. ko refers to semisolids. What's a semisolid? Often toki ponists forget that most English speakers don't use this descriptor. A semisolid is something that has solid elements to it, but isn't hard and doesn't resist a change in shape. Some examples are toothpaste, salt, sponges, jello, paint, clay, soil, flour, and sand. The throughline here is that ko ignores moisture completely. If you take any of these examples that are dry and add water, they become wet. Some dissolve into the water and supersaturate it, becoming something very similar and yet very distinct from a liquid. Some, such as flour and soil, become moldable and retain their shape (for example, a dough or some sort of clay). A sponge becomes easier to reform and manipulate when it gets wet. A good thought experiment to get to know ko better is to choose any ko and think about what happens to it when the amount of water changes. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/pbGZlWAoISQ">my youtube video</a> on ko for more info.</p>

            <summary id="kon">kon</summary> 
            <p>kon covers a very wide range of ideas that are loosely related to each other through the concept of being known, but not seen. You'll often hear people use the phrase "unseen agent" to describe kon. I've divided this semantic space into three parts: spirits, meaning, and gas. toki pona connects these concepts by giving them all the same word, but this throughline is only a metaphor. In my opinion, these are three distinct senses, not one meaning.</p>
            <p>If you'll indulge my spiritual worldview for a bit, a spirit could be some sort of supernatural being that we don't normally see. There are countless traditions around the globe that interpret divinity through unseen agents. For example, in christianity, the concept of the holy ghost could very easily be a type of kon. Dybbukim in Jewish folklore can easily be kon because they're not things people commonly see. If a spirit shows itself and becomes seen, using kon still works great to communicate that it <em>frequently</em> is an unseen agent. The idea of a spirit can be extended to the part of humans or beings, depending on how a speaker considers the idea of a soul. Some people think that everything has a soul, while others think that only humans have souls. kon works very well for all of these souls, framing them as the unseen part of things. In fact, a minority of speakers goes as far to call aspects of identity like gender types of kon. The broad idea behind this category is that kon can be used for, specifically, an unseen <em>entity.</em></p>
            <p>"Meaning" is a broad category. The most common usage of kon for meaning is semantic meaning, i.e. the meaning of words in language. Every semantic space entry in this dictionary could be described as an instance of "kon." If a speaker didn't know what another speaker meant even though they heard all the words, they could say that they didn't understand the "kon." Less often you'll see kon used for more abstract ideas of meaning, such as the meaning of a piece of art. This category is about unseen <em>ideas</em> or parts of <em>thought.</em></p>
            <p>Finally, gas. air is a very prototypical example of kon, but air is composed of a very specific set of gaseous matter. Even if a gas is visible, like steam or smoke, it's still squarely part of kon's semantic space. The entirety of Jupiter can be kon. Clouds can be kon. Hell, the sun can even be kon if you're looking at what composes it and framing it from that perspective instead of framing it as a producer of light.</p>

Usually a kulupu will be a group of items that have some sort of shared attribute, and using kulupu to describe a group of anything is emphasizing that they have something in common.

            <p>laso talks about both blues and greens at the same time. it can describe a large range of colors that are often separated in other languages, such as English. In English, blue and green are separate concepts with their own semantic space. In toki pona (as well as countless languages across the world), these concepts are merged into one. Many linguists affectionally call this color "grue" in the contexts of analyzing other languages, and the term can be helpful here because it gives a fantastic anchor for color perspective to English speakers. Think to yourself how often it is crucial to distinguish between blue and green. In cases where you wish to do so, greens are yellower than blues, so it's easy to modify laso with a word like "jelo" to specify that, but if you don't <em>need</em> to specify, doing so adds more clutter to your speaking. I wouldn't go much darker than cobalt blue before using pimeja instead. because cool colors like laso tend to be darker a lot of the time, don't forget about pimeja!</p>
            <p>Another part of laso worth mentioning is purples. While somewhat controversial, when I showed several toki ponists color chips (the kind you use when choosing which color to paint your wall), most of the darker or bluer shades of purple that were not dark enough to be pimeja were unanimously laso. Some of the lighter or pinker ones were called loje. There was also some overlap, and some people stated the importance of the surrounding colors. These are all things to keep in mind when you encounter a color that seems hard to talk about in toki pona. I'm often reminded of paints, and a purple like dioxazine violet would most definitely be pimeja and not laso.</p>

Commanding troops in battle is a type of lawa. lawa doesn't imply any level of consent, so it could be forceful or gentle. Guiding a swimming student's body into the correct position for good technique could be lawa, but plenty of things that I'm not willing to describe could be lawa as well.</p>

For example, a document on a computer, while in no way as flimsy as a paper, is still very much lipu. If you take the writing off of a piece of paper, it's just as much a lipu. Some speakers argue that this is an extended metaphor and by using lipu to describe these files, one is framing the computer as a lipu. For example, in Southeast Asia, language was written on dried palm leaves, which without writing are still lipu. In fact, many speakers use lipu for all leaves, be they large or small, without any implications of writing. Anything flat and flimsy can be a lipu for these speakers. As soon as it gets hard, it's likely to be a supa unless it has writing on it, though. For example, a maya stelae <em>could</em> be lipu, but a rock shaped like one with no writing on it would almost definitely not be.</p>

It's about caretaking. This doesn't always have to do with age. A worker at a nursing home could be a mama. Another fun example of mama is a tree that bears fruit. If all of the seeds are its children, then the tree could be mama! Thinking about mama like this can be fun and allows a lot of freedom in exploring its semantic space.</p>

            <p>mani speaks to things used in trade, such as fiat money, livestock, spices, or anything else being framed as a tool of bartering. anything can be mani, but by using mani for it you're throwing most of its other qualities to the side. For example, if I use mani to describe coriander, I am framing its culinary usage as irrelevant. I do not care if it will be cooked with. I only care that it will be used in an exchange.</p>

            <p>The semantic space of mije contains men and masculinity. The semantic space of meli contains women and femininity. These words are as well defined as the concepts they represent, so it's left intentionally broad without specifying further. This means that for beings that can talk to you, they decide if they fit within the semantic space of either of these words.</p>
            <p>A common question is "can mije and meli be used to refer to biological sex?" The answer is extremely complicated. First, it's worth unpacking the concept of biological sex, which I'm not going to do here. (If you want to learn more about that, research "intersex.") That can inform the ethics of using mije and meli to talk about biological sex. As for trans people, they usually identify their bodies with their gender and not their biological sex at birth. That doesn't mean that no trans person has ever said something along the lines of "my body is mije, but I am meli" to explain their transness. It's up to the individual to decide how they want to identify. For example, it is incredibly disrespectful to use mije to describe the body or any attribute of someone who does not identify under that word if you haven't cleared it with them first, and even asking them if it's okay is, at the very least, a little weird. (The same goes for meli as well as tonsi.) There are quite a few trans members of the toki pona community, so this matters a lot.</p>

            <p>moku is the act of eating. It is also used to refer to anything eaten. even if it's not edible, you can use moku to describe it! doing so implies that it is in some context eaten, though, so be careful. There's a quote from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005). "Everything here is edible; even I'm edible. But that, dear children, is cannibalism, and is in fact frowned upon in most societies." Use this ancient wisdom from two decades ago to guide your moku usage. Evoking cannibalism is not always the desired effect!</p>
            <p>People will occasionally extend moku by metaphor. moku is at its base a physical word describing a physical act, so these metaphors are secondary, but I've seen moku for "overcome" in some contexts. Like "toki Epelanto li moku e toki Potuke mi" could be a fun way to phrase "Ever since I've started learning Esperanto, my Portuguese proficiency has been on the decline." This is pretty similar to <a href="#weka">weka</a>, but keep in mind that most instances of moku are simply another angle from some instance of weka. When you eat something, it doesn't exist anymore, at least not in its original form or environment. You're <em>removing</em> it. Reframing a type of weka as a type of moku will frame the act from the perspective of ingesting nutrition and may draw attention away from the removal of that thing.</p>

            <p>moli means death, but what does death mean? Sometimes, moli describes a kind of destruction that cannot be undone. Death is permanent. But other times, moli can describe harm or destruction that comes to a treasured object. In these situations, there is still usually a sense of permanency. "ilo mi li moli" would probably be interpreted as "my phone is broken," or even "my phone is broken beyond repair," but probably not "my phone is out of battery." That doesn't mean that moli inherently means that there is no possible way to undo the destruction. For example, if resurrection was real, I might still use moli for death anyway. Many cultures believe in reincarnation, life after death, or some sort of returning to nature. Perhaps in these frameworks, moli still describes permanence, but it's not inherently negative.</p>

            <p>The semantic space of mu contains noises coming from things being framed as living. A lion's roar is mu. A cough is mu. Humans are animals, but often when they say things, we can understand them, so we might choose to use a different word over mu. But mu is often used to describe languages and vocalizations that are not understood by the speaker. Adjacently, many people describe non-language vocalizations as mu, such as coughs, sneezes, or vocal stims.</p> 
            <p>By using mu to describe a noise, you are ascribing some level of livingness to the thing that produced it. Using mu to describe a robot's noise makes the robot feel more like a living thing. This can be taken to any extreme, and it often ends up seeming humorous. For example, the sound of some sizzling bacon could be a mu, which is thought provoking. But the sound of a waterfall can also be mu, which is thought provoking in a completely different way. Ascribing qualities of life and animacy to bacon and waterfalls are very different situations. With bacon, it becomes a joke, where the punchline is that mu is an "animal noise" and sizzling is an "animal noise." But with a waterfall, it becomes a deep philosophical musing about what life is.</p> 
            <p>Using mu to describe the vocalizations of animals is usually a safe bet, but using it in other circumstances can be very profound.</p>

Whenever one of my professors asks a question about "how many" of something there are, I always say "like three," whether that be tubes of paint or languages in the world or measures in a Bach chorale.</p>
            <p>mute doesn't specify a huge or small number. a few, several, a lot, and a ton are all mute. Usually in context, it's easy to tell these amounts apart. mute as a noun means "amount" and as a verb it can mean either "multiply" or "divide." If I cut a kili in pieces, now I have many kili, and if I cast a spell to multiply a kili into multiple kili, I have many kili, so either way it doesn't matter. Unless it does matter, in which case, ask yourself: why does it matter? The answer to that question will guide you on disambiguating efficiently. mute is used as a general intensifier too when modifying some sort of quality or another modifier.</p>

If someone grows ten types of herbs and a single carnivorous plant, then that carnivorous plant is nasa. If most people don't grow herbs, someone who does grow herbs is nasa. What's considered "normal" here is completely reliant on context. A clown isn't nasa if everyone around them is also a clown. Nothing is inherently nasa. The nasa-ness of all objects will change along with context.</p>
            <p>I've also seen people use "ike" and "pona" sometimes to modify nasa, clarifying the connotation. Because nasa doesn't have any positive or negative connotations, people whose native languages DO have these connotations associated with weirdness may feel inspired to clarify when the strangeness of something is good or bad. More commonly I see people use "pona" to counteract any assumptions that nasa may be a bad thing in context, but especially in the queer circles surrounding toki pona, weirdness is embraced a lot to the point where this may not be needed. I wouldn't consider modifying nasa like this to be a bad thing! Clarifying connotations is never a bad thing if you feel it's necessary.</p>

            <p>nena describes parts of a surface that stick out from the parts around it. For example, a button on a computer keyboard could be a nena. A knot in a tree could be a nena. Small toes can be nena. Fingers are probably too long to be nena, but if you use nena for them, you're framing them as bumps as opposed to long objects or a grasping organ. nena can be dull or sharp. A speed bump can be a nena and a hill can be a nena, but so can a spike or a sharp peak of a mountain. Some nena are pleasant to touch, and others might draw blood. If I wanted to make a nena no longer a nena, all I'd need to do is smooth it into the rest of the surface it's part of such that it no longer bulges out.</p>
            <p>Another important part of nena's semantic space is its usage for the nose. The nose is a bump, which is why nena can describe it, but as a transitive verb, nena becomes rapidly useful to describe active smelling. Wafting the aroma of roasting chicken can be a type of nena, as an action, but it's drawing attention to the nose. It makes the agent (i.e. the one that smells) a key part of the situation.</p>

            <summary id="ni">ni</summary>
            <p>ni is similar to "this" and "that" and "yonder" in english. it is used in two different contexts. The easiest way to use ni is to point at a physical object. This could be demonstrated with a finger, a gesture of the head, a glance, or even a drawn arrow. In those contexts, the semantic space of "ni" is that thing you're pointing at. You can also use ni as a modifier to be more specific. Are you pointing at a specific box? You can say "poki ni." are you pointing at a specific location? "ma ni" works just as well as "ni." What about the current situation? "tenpo ni" is perfect for this!</p>
            <p>extended into the metaphorical, ni can also be used to point at things you or others have said. It always stands in for at least one clause (a clause is any phrase with a verb in it). Most often you'll see it standing in for a previous or upcoming sentence.</p>
            <p>ni can also be used as a modifier to elaborate on a word in a sentence. If your sentences are getting too long, ni is among the easiest way to break it up. you can turn "mi wile e soweli pi linja pi suwi mute" into "mi wile e soweli ni: linja ona li suwi mute." Note how "ona" in the next sentence stands in for "soweli ni." If you want to learn more about this, look into <em>anaphora</em> and <em>deixis.</em></p>
            <p>toki pona lacks proximity distinctions, unlike english. In english, the difference between "this" and "that" and "yonder" is how close the object is to the speaker and listener. toki pona's "ni" can fill the meaning of any of these. It is more general, but you can usually tell what it's talking about due to context. If you're worried that people might not be able to tell where something is, you can say how close it is by using "poka" and "weka," among other tools.</p>

            <p>olin describes the act of being emotionally bonded to someone something. In usage, these bonds are typically positive and strong. For example, a very good friend, a partner, a family member, or a pet. Not only could the love for a very good friend be olin, but so can the friend. This can be used with objects too. The bond between many toki ponists and the language toki pona is olin. This isn't the same thing as liking something. By using olin, you are evoking some sort of emotional bond. Note that olin doesn't describe all emotional bonds between two things. So if I don't like someone a lot but I still respect them deeply, I could still use olin to describe the respect, but probably not how I don't like them. Using olin for respect is a less common usage.</p>
            <p>Some people do actually use olin far more broadly. For example, a minor form of attraction, like enjoying a food a lot. This is less common in my experience, often less likely to be understood, and the attitudes towards this usage are often negative, mostly because it seems like an anglicization. However, some people take it further and use olin to talk about the attraction between magnets, or the delicate bond between math and physics. If you do choose to use olin more broadly, please don't stop where English does and consider taking the meaning a bit farther in a more creative way. </p>

It also has no gender connotation, just like every other toki pona word, so it can just as easily mean he or she or they.</p>
            <!--note from lipamanka: some toki pona words have meanings that when translated to english have animacy connotations, such as tomo and poki, or mu and kalama, which could be seen as "animate" and "inanimate" respectively. do not be fooled! what you might be reading as an animacy distinction is actually not, just normal connotations.

This isn't something special that pakala does, but pakala is used this way because the situations we swear in are often situations where we've made mistakes, or when something has been destroyed. pakala can also be intentional, such as smash therapy or intentional use of explosions. pakala can also describe harm. If something cut my skin, I might use pakala to describe that. In fact, pakala merges the ideas of harm and destruction.

            <p>pali is work. But what does that mean? In toki pona, pali needs at least a little bit of effort, and it needs to make a little bit of something. But if it only had a little of each, calling it "pali" might be a worse choice than using another word. Just because eating requires a little work and makes energy inside of your body doesn't mean pali will be understood. So almost always, pali will either require a lot of effort or create a significant thing. A professional potter making pottery might not require a lot of effort because they are skilled enough, but it will create a significant object. And on the reverse, learning a new language may not create a significant object (just some new knowledge in your head), but it does require a lot of effort.</p>
            <p>pali is, at its core, a transitive verb. Therefore, as a noun, pali is something that has been made or worked on. This could be a specific project, document, device, invention, practice session, job, task, etc.</p>

If a palisa is looked at from a different perspective where there is enough power to bend it, it might not firmly sit within palisa's semantic space. A good test that works most of the time is to check to see if it’s flexible enough to be bent into a 0 degree angle or if it’s flexible enough to be tied in a knot, if it is, then it’s probably not a palisa.</p>

            <p>Taughtness is an interesting thing to think about with palisa. I used to sail a lot, and some ropes (lines, we called them) were always taught and effectively served the same function as any poles we could grab onto. These were called "shrouds," and I would definitely have used palisa to describe them, even though in their relaxed form they would be as pliable as any rope. So when something becomes reliably taught enough, you can use "palisa" to describe it.</p>

This could talk about specific colors like deep red or dark emerald green, but it can also talk about shadows, places where there is less light, or the absence of brighter colors. pimeja can describe anything that is dark. From some perspectives, the night is a type of darkness more than a period of time (just as a day can be a type of brightness and a year can be a type of circle around the sun).</p>

            <p>pipi tend to be on the smaller side. They can have legs, and their legs will be under them. They usually have six or more legs if they have any at all. When they move quickly, they will usually move in straight lines, whether that be across a surface or through the air. Sometimes, they don't have legs. pipi tend to be squishy inside, and if there's a hard part it will be on the outside. This is similar to the concept of an exoskeleton.</p>

            <p>pipi Kewapi has at times emphasized insignificance as a big part of pipi. We kill pipi. Perhaps as a group pipi are important, but, and I quote, "a single pipi is not a loss." This means that if one pipi were to die, it wouldn't affect much. I recommend experimenting with what can or can't be a pipi.</p>
            <!--pipi Kewapi: I think an important part of pipi is insignificance. pipi aren't just lili – pipi are suli ala. pipi wan li moli la ni li ike ala e kulupu pipi. jan li ken wile moli e pipi. This is evidenced in how pipi gets used as an insult or a comparison point, and it's also evidenced in the pipi/akesi divide
            pipi Kewapi: I think on dictionary pipi as insignificant is maybe relevant to include but idk if the deeper stuff about non-individuality is
            lipamanka: so pipi swarm and group together with other pipi?
            pipi Kewapi: Possibly. But also relevantly a single pipi is not a loss
            -->

            <p>Note that pipi don't have to be terrestrial! They can fly or be aquatic. There's significant overlap between pipi and both kala and waso. A butterfly is a waso and a pipi, where a shrimp is both a kala and a pipi.</p>

            <p>poka is at its core is anything, either an object or location, that is nearby or to the side of something else. This could be the space next to someone, or at the side of someone, such as the lefthand side of a walking person. But this can also be part of an object, such as someone's hips or a car door. Extended into the metaphorical space, poka becomes extremely useful for talking about relationships. toki ponists tend to place people and objects they have relationships with in proximity with them, so one might describe a friend as poka and a loose acquaintance as not poka. two things don't have to be physically next to each other in order to be "lon poka." my uncles live in <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-referring-to-new-zealand-as-aotearoa-is-a-meaningful-step-for-travelers">aotearoa</a> and I live in the USA on either Dakota or Lenape land depending on the time of year, but I would still describe our relationship using poka despite the physical displacement.</p>

Furniture that contains things, such as trash cans, drawers, shelves, and even closets, are a big part of poki. Some poki might be metaphysical rather than physical. All semantic spaces of all toki pona words can be framed as poki, containing possible meanings. You could look at labels through this lens, and people who choose to use a label are placing themselves within the semantic space of said label. This usage of poki is fairly common.

"pona" can be any good quality, but to truly understand pona, one must understand the reason behind each decision made when creating toki pona. This is why in toki pona it's so easy to call the language "toki pona"--it's the language that most closely fits the design goals, which are also the semantic space of the word "pona." you'll seldom see speakers who disagree with this and describe toki pona as <em>not</em> pona, but that's because most of the people who don't like toki pona's design don't speak it very well if at all.</p>

Household appliances used to heat food can be seli, like a stovetop. seli can be used as a verb to mean "cook," if in english you see cooking as always some sort of application of heat. Chopping up vegetables to put in a raw salad isn't a good example of seli.</p>

            <p>selo describes the outer layer of an object. It doesn't matter what the object is. For example, skin can be selo, and bark can be selo. This can get extended into the metaphorical. What are outer layers for? Usually, they protect that which is inside. Perhaps an attempt to ignore bigotry could be described as a selo. But in doing so, you're framing it as an outer layer of your mind. selo for "protect" has a different vibe when compared with awen's protect meaning. With awen, a protection is an act of maintaining, perhaps from afar with no risk to yourself, but with selo, protection always puts something at risk, be it the skin of an apple, the walls of a castle, or the case of a guitar.</p>
            <p>selo don't always have to contain anything important, even though they usually do. Balloons are usually empty (save for air) and they can still be selo. In fact, a vacuum chamber's walls could be selo, even though they literally have nothing inside of the (save for "dark energy" or whatever don't @ me I'm not a physicist). As a verb, selo can mean "to surround fully," or "to become the outer layer of (something)." Some people use this for hugging, which is very fun.</p>

It is an invitation for an answer. this is very similar to wh- words in english like "what" and "which" and "who." unlike english, toki pona only has the one. If you want to specify what your query is about, you can modify a different word with seme. "kasi seme" can mean "which plant," for example. often, seme is a direct prompt to the listener, but it's frequently used as a prompt to the self or an expression of a lack of knowledge. speakers sometimes ask a question with seme only to answer it. Perhaps this is a me thing because I am jewish and that is how many jews tend to talk.</p>

            <p>sewi embodies a very powerful conceptual metaphor that exists within toki pona. In toki pona, upwards and high things and divinity are connected. These are two separate ideas that sewi connects by referring to both of them. Things that are religious or sacred can be sewi. For example, a religion could be "nasin sewi," religious art can be "sitelen sewi", and a god, practitioner, or religious wisdom holder can all be "jan sewi." sewi on its own can easily refer to that which is divine or worshipped. But sewi very simply talks about the space above something. "sewi kiwen" can mean "the space above the rock" or "the top of the rock." Keep in mind that all of these examples can work in the other sense of sewi. "nasin sewi" can mean an upwards direction, "sitelen sewi" can be the top painting of two paintings, and "jan sewi" can be someone who just climbed a big mountain. And of course, "sewi kiwen" could be the divinity of a rock.</p>

"utala sike" could be a never ending cycle of war, or some online discourse that just won't end. Whether it's physical or not, a sike will always loop around and end where it started.</p>

I recommend paying attention to sin's usage in the wild to try to figure out if it's ever ambiguous between new and again. The reason why it isn't is because the difference between those two concepts isn't very far. It doesn't matter if you've done it before. In toki pona, something can be new even if it isn't the first time it's happened.</p>
            <p>sin can mean a lot of things, and that range of possibility is given by explaining what something is new <em>to.</em> children are new to this world, toki pona learners are new to toki pona communities, a new brand of soda is new to the Free Market Economy which we all Love So Much, etc. These can all be sin!</p>

But besides situations like that, sina always includes the listener. Many people also use sina as a general hypothetical pronoun, similar to "one" in english when used as a pronoun. Others use sina when talking to inanimate objects. Perhaps this frames the object as listening. I recommend playing around with this at least a little bit.</p>

            <p>sinpin can't be extended into a metaphorical space to talk about time.

A random scribble is still a sitelen even though it doesn't necessarily represent anything. pure random noise has the potential to be a sitelen too, but doing so will likely frame the noise as having some sort of order to it. perhaps it was chosen? maybe it's being used for something? maybe it's a mistake? explore sitelen!</p>
            <p>Ask yourself: is static a type of sitelen? When does randomness become something we can see as made with intent? Must we name something for it to have meaning to us? If nobody looks at a picture, is it still a sitelen?</p>

A warning to english speaking learners: the type of knowledge that sona covers doesn't completely contain the english concept of "knowing someone."

That means that a surface with very high friction (like felt) can continue to be supa for longer than something with very low friction (like a flat sheet of teflon). if you have stuck things to a surface and turn it completely upside down, it can stay a supa.</p>

            <p>It's always good to check before calling someone "tonsi" directly, but know that most binary trans toki pona speakers won't be upset when called "tonsi." As for binary trans people generally or as a group, this usage is controversial among binary trans people. Use this data to guide your own usage. "should" has a slight edge on "should not," especially considering that the people who don't care are likely fine with the usage and just won't advocate that others SHOULD use it. A few respondents contacted me to share this sentiment.</p>                
            <p>A notable bias here is that a transmedicalist who believes that this usage of tonsi is transphobic sent the form out in her circles multiple times, encouraging people to "reject tonsi." I have done nothing of the sort to try to skew data either way.</p>
            <p>Full analysis of data is pending, but the <a href="https://forms.gle/9fvAX5Fj5tfybGyH9">form</a> is closed. The sociology of gender, transphobia, etc around this is not something I will get into here for brevity, so enjoy these cold heartless numbers.</p>
            <p>tonsi is one of the only words on this list (in fact, it may be the only one) that is not featured in <em>Toki Pona: the Language of Good</em> by Sonja Lang. It's considered important because toki pona has ways of talking about men and women, but no easy way to talk about nonbinary people. This is why I included it. If you look up frequency of usage, frequency for tonsi may be lower than some other words that are not featured in <em>Toki Pona: the Language of Good</em> by Sonja Lang. This is because many speakers don't use tonsi, meli, <em>or</em> mije. If a speaker uses meli and mije, they will almost definitely also use tonsi from time to time.</p>

            <summary id="tu">tu</summary>
            <p>tu is, at its core, an act of separation. in toki pona, if there are two of something, one is framing them as separate. you don't need to modify a word with tu in order for there to be two of it, so using tu is saying something: I am separating these two things. "kili tu" can evoke an importance between two heads of lettuce. tu is used frequently as a verb to mean "cut" or "divide." it can be used for cutting something into more than two pieces because tu doesn't specify a specific amount of times. like "mi tu e kili" could describe four separate cuts, which could be up to 16 pieces! tu can also be metaphysical, describing divorce or any type of distance between people or objects with enough context. some other good examples of tu are splitting up a class into two groups or drawing the boundaries between two subparts of a large piece of land, potentially in a colonial context.</p>

                <p>unpa's semantic space has to do with sex and sexual activity. The number of participants doesn't matter; solo masturbation is equally as valid to describe as unpa as an orgy, as is anything between. Kink can be a part of unpa, but it is specifically framed as a part of sex, whether in the lead-up as in foreplay, in the act, or any other part of sex. For comparison, horniness and other feelings or concepts related to sex are generally not called unpa, but they are often considered in their relationship to sex. Additionally, sexual positions and sexual preferences are generally not unpa, as they are not the act. However, they may be framed in their relationship to sex, such as by use of the word unpa as a modifier.</p>
                <p>Gender and biological sex do not play a role in unpa's semantic space; put another way, unpa doesn't change when the identities of those involved change. It is still unpa.</p>
                <p>Reproduction also generally does not play a role in unpa's semantic space, a feature it shares with the word "sex" describing the act but not reproduction. Reproduction may be referenced in relation to unpa, such as when discussing breeding animals, but unpa generally does not imply or refer to reproduction on its own. There are caveats to this however; some speakers will use unpa to refer to pollination, one of the means by which plants reproduce. By the use of unpa, this is being framed as a sexual act at the same time as an act of reproduction; this is by analogy to sex, as pollination is the closest similar thing that applies to plants.</p>

            <p>uta is a mouth or oral opening. astomatous objects do not have uta, but all other objects do. by using uta to describe something, you are framing it with all the connotations of an animal's mouth. the mouth of a venus flytrap could very easily be something else, but using uta for it emphasizes that it consumes. uta often create noises like vocalizations, so people tend to call voice chats and spoken language "toki uta."</p>

            <summary id="utala">utala</summary>
            <p>The semantic space of utala contains conflicts, contests, and battles. When utala is used, it’s talking about some sort of struggle or competition between two or more parties, or something being framed that way. So it could be a battle between two rival armies, but it could also be a battle between me and myself if I’m framing it that way. utala is often targeted, closer to “attack” than “battle.” Anything can be an utala if it is being framed as a struggle or attack of some sort that involves two parties. Playing a musical instrument could be an utala for a beginner player. Taking a test is a very fun thing to call an utala, because the test-taker is fighting the test.</p>

            <p>It is best to think about wan as first and foremost some type of union. other objects are coming together into one whole. That kind of motion is core to the word "wan." the number meaning is secondary. wan is used frequently to mean combine, marry, mix, overlap, etc. using wan as a modifier can indeed mean that there is only one of something, but it's always good to think about it as a single unified whole.</p>

            <p>waso are creatures. they almost always have wings, and when they want to move quickly they use those wings to propel them forward. They frequently have feathers. They have two legs that they use to walk on land. waso usually lay eggs and often (but not always) sing. many speakers use waso to refer to things like planes that aren't living creatures, which has been especially common in my experience with toki pona meetups, where the flight itself and the plane are both called waso. This usage is controversial though. waso can be used to refer to birds that don't fly or use their wings to fly, such as ostriches, kiwi birds, or penguins, and doing so shows the way you split up the animal kingdom. there are quite a few speakers (including myself) who don't use waso for these creatures, and that shows the way we split up the animal kingdom too. This semantic space is based off a pilot study I conducted with a sample size of 117. I will publish the results in a paper if enough people bother me.</p>

            <summary id="wawa">wawa</summary>
            <p>wawa is qualities of power and strength. A very strong person is wawa. The strength required to talk to new people one has never met before is wawa. wawa focuses less on the ability or possibility itself and more on the power and motivation behind it. wawa belongs to things with agency. If something is enabled, it is wawa. For example, if a lightbulb has been turned on, it becomes wawa. wawa is used frequently to refer to energy itself, both in an abstract sense (such as spoons or motivation) and in a physical sense, such as electricity or force. Many people aren't wawa until they drink their morning coffee. The coffee makes them wawa.</p>
            <p>Another great angle of "wawa" is the concept of saturation and concentration. For example, a strong drink (as in, one that has a lot of alcohol) is wawa, but as you dilute it with water, it becomes less wawa. Another example is paint. Saturated paint mixed with a neutral shade of paint (like gray, black, or white) will slowly and slowly become less wawa. Depending on how salty water is, one could describe it as wawa, for example if comparing saltwater fish to freshwater fish.</p>

            <p>weka describes distance. It is similar to other location words in that it can describe a place, but instead of describing a specific relation to proximity, it describes the lack thereof. Hence, weka describes a place that is not nearby. This could be outside a house or simply outside of reality. It can describe the act of disappearing or vanishing. Transitively, it can mean the act of removal or stealing. weka can also be more passive as an action, such as ignoring, just as easily as it can be an active action like getting rid of something.</p>

            <summary id="wile">wile</summary>
            <p>The semantic space of wile contains all desires. A desire to eat is a wile. A desire to be near others is a wile. These desires can be influenced by external forces: a desire to do tedious chores motivated by the prospect of negative consequences is a wile. By using wile to describe something, it's being framed as a type of desire. For example, if I normally don't want to tidy up my workspace but I feel obligated to anyway, if I used wile to describe that feeling of obligation, I'd be describing it as some sort of desire. This can be used for anything, no matter how animate. Speakers frame non-living objects as having desires very frequently.</p>
            <p>A warning I have for wile is assuming it contains the idea of a "need." A "need" is a complex concept and trying to use wile to describe it is misguided. While most needs can be framed as types of desires, the goal of "wile" isn't to merge those concepts, it's to throw one of them away. This enables a toki ponist to align their desires with their actions by giving them a word to describe their desires without any complex connotation. Sometimes it's more useful to say "my body wants food, but I don't want to eat."</p>
            <p>Another part of wile's usage is its use as a preverb. wile changes the sentence it's part of to make the subject desire to perform the verb, rather than just performing it. It's similar to the word "want" in english.</p>
